<p>Welcome to our weekly roundup, where we share what you need to know about the cybersecurity news and events that happened over the past few days. This week, learn about 5 reasons your organization should consider moving to a cloud managed solution. Also, read about a massive online fraud operation that has been mimicking smart TVs to fool online advertisers and gain unearned profits from online ads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read on:</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/ceoletter/"><strong>Letter from the CEO: A Time of Kindness and Compassion</strong></a></p>
<p><em>As a global company with headquarters in Japan, Trend Micro has been exposed to COVID-19 from the very early days when it first erupted in Asia. During these difficult times, Trend Micro has also witnessed the amazing power of positivity and kindness around the world. In this blog, read more about the importance of compassion during these unprecedented times from Trend Micro’s CEO, Eva Chen. </em></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/what-do-serverless-compute-platforms-mean-for-security/"><strong>What Do Serverless Compute Platforms Mean for Security?</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Developers deploying containers to restricted platforms or “serverless” containers to the likes of AWS Fargate, for example, should think about security differently – by looking upward, looking left and also looking all-around your cloud domain for opportunities to properly security your cloud native applications. </em></p>
<p><a href="https://threatpost.com/april-patch-tuesday-microsoft-active-exploit/154794/"><strong>April Patch Tuesday: Microsoft Battles 4 Bugs Under Active Exploit</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Microsoft released its April 2020 Patch Tuesday security updates, its first big patch update released since the work-from-home era began, with a whopping 113 vulnerabilities. Microsoft has seen a 44% increase in the number of CVEs patched between January to April 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019, according to Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative – a likely result of an increasing number of researchers looking for bugs and an expanding portfolio of supported products.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/5-reasons-to-move-your-endpoint-security-to-the-cloud-now/"><strong>5 Reasons to Move Your Endpoint Security to the Cloud Now</strong></a></p>
<p><em>As the world adopts work from home initiatives, we’ve seen many organizations accelerate their plans to move from on-premises endpoint security and detection and response (EDR/XDR) solutions to SaaS versions. In this blog, learn about 5 reasons you should consider moving to a cloud managed solution.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://containerjournal.com/topics/container-security/why-running-a-privileged-container-is-not-a-good-idea/"><strong>Why Running a Privileged Container is Not a Good Idea</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Containers are not, by any means, new. They have been consistently and increasingly adopted in the past few years, with security being a popular related topic. It is well-established that giving administrative powers to server users is not a good security practice. In the world of containers, we have the same paradigm. In this article, Trend Micro’s Fernando Cardoso explains why running a privileged container is a bad idea. </em></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/why-cisos-are-demanding-detection-and-response-everywhere/"><strong>Why CISOs Are Demanding Detection and Response Everywhere</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Over the past three decades, Trend Micro has observed the industry trends that have the biggest impact on its customers. One of the big things we’ve noticed is that threats move largely in tandem with changes to IT infrastructure. As digital transformation continues to remain a priority, it also comes with an expanded corporate attack surface, driving security leaders to demand enhanced visibility, detection and response across the entire enterprise — not just the endpoint.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/shift-well-architecture-left-by-extension-security-will-follow/"><strong>Shift Well-Architecture Left. By Extension, Security Will Follow</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the norm in the cloud. From CloudFormation, CDK, Terraform, Serverless Framework and ARM, the options are nearly endless. IaC allows architects and DevOps engineers to version the application infrastructure as much as the developers are already versioning the code. So, any bad change, no matter if on the application code or infrastructure, can be easily inspected or, even better, rolled back.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bai.org/banking-strategies/article-detail/work-from-home-presents-data-security-challenge-for-banks"><strong>Work from Home Presents a Data Security Challenge for Banks</strong></a></p>
<p><em>The mass relocation of financial services employees from the office to their couch, dining table or spare room to stop the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus is a significant data security concern, according to several industry experts. In this article, learn how managers can support security efforts from Trend Micro’s Bill Malik. </em></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/principles-of-a-cloud-migration-security-the-w5h/"><strong>Principles of a Cloud Migration – Security, The W5H</strong></a></p>
<p><em>For as long as cloud providers have been in business, discussing the Shared Responsibility Model has been priority when it comes to customer operation teams. It defines the different aspects of control, and with that control, comes the need to secure, manage, and maintain. In this blog, Trend Micro highlights some of the requirements and discusses the organization’s layout for responsibility.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/coronavirus-update-app-leads-to-project-spy-android-and-ios-spyware/"><strong>Coronavirus Update App Leads to Project Spy Android and iOS Spyware</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Trend Micro </em><em>discovered a potential cyberespionage campaign, dubbed Project Spy, that infects Android and iOS devices with spyware. Project Spy uses the COVID-19 pandemic as a lure, posing as an app called ‘Coronavirus Updates’. Trend Micro also found similarities in two older samples disguised as a Google service and, subsequently, as a music app. Trend Micro noted a small number of downloads of the app in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada and Russia.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/exposing-modular-adware-how-dealply-iserik-and-managex-persist-in-systems/"><strong>Exposing Modular Adware: How DealPly, IsErIk, and ManageX Persist in Systems</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Trend Micro has observed suspicious activities caused by adware, with common behaviors that include access to random domains with alternating consonant and vowel names, scheduled tasks, and in-memory execution via WScript that has proven to be an effective method to hide its operations. In this blog, Trend Micro walks through its analysis of three adware events linked to and named as Dealply, IsErIk and ManageX. </em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/icebucket-group-mimicked-smart-tvs-to-steal-ad-money/"><strong>ICEBUCKET Group Mimicked Smart TVs to Steal Ad Money</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Cybersecurity firm and bot detection platform White Ops has discovered a massive online fraud operation that for the past few months has been mimicking smart TVs to fool online advertisers and gain unearned profits from online ads. White Ops has named this operation ICEBUCKET and has described it as &#8220;the largest case of SSAI spoofing&#8221; known to date.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/fake-messaging-app-installers-promoted-on-fraudulent-download-sites-target-russian-users">Fake Messaging App Installers Promoted on Fraudulent Download Sites, Target Russian Users</a></strong></p>
<p><em>Fake installers of popular messaging apps are being propagated via fraudulent download sites, as disclosed in a series of tweets by a security researcher from CronUp. Trend Micro has also encountered samples of the files. The sites and the apps are in Russian and are aiming to bait Russian users.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/-twin-flower-campaign-jacks-up-network-traffic-downloads-files-steals-data"><strong>“Twin Flower” Campaign Jacks Up Network Traffic, Downloads Files, Steals Data</strong></a></p>
<p><em>A campaign dubbed “Twin Flower” has been detected by Jinshan security researchers in a report published in Chinese and analyzed by Trend Micro. The files are believed to be downloaded unknowingly when visiting malicious sites or dropped into the system by another malware. The potentially unwanted application (PUA) PUA.Win32.BoxMini.A files are either a component or the main executable itself of a music downloader that automatically downloads music files without user consent.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/virtualization-and-cloud/undertaking-security-challenges-in-hybrid-cloud-environments"><strong>Undertaking Security Challenges in Hybrid Cloud Environments</strong></a></p>
<p><em>Businesses are now turning to hybrid cloud environments to make the most of the cloud’s dependability and dynamicity. The hybrid cloud gives organizations the speed and scalability of the public cloud, as well as the control and reliability of the private cloud. A 2019 Nutanix survey shows that 85% of its respondents regard the hybrid cloud as the ideal IT operating model.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/security-technology/how-to-secure-video-conferencing-apps"><strong>How to Secure Video Conferencing Apps</strong></a></p>
<p><em>What do businesses have to be wary of when it comes to their video conferencing software? Vulnerabilities, for one. Threat actors are not shy about using everything they have in their toolbox and are always on the lookout for any flaw or vulnerability they can exploit to pull off malicious attacks. In this blog, learn about securing your video conferencing apps and best practices for strengthening the security of work-from-home setups.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/monitoring-and-maintaining-trend-micro-home-network-security-part-4-best-practices/"><strong>Monitoring and Maintaining Trend Micro Home Network Security – Part 4: Best Practices</strong></a></p>
<p><em>In the last blog of this four-part series, Trend Micro delves deeper into regular monitoring and maintenance of home network security, to ensure you’re getting the best protection that Trend Micro Home Network Security can provide your connected home.</em></p>
