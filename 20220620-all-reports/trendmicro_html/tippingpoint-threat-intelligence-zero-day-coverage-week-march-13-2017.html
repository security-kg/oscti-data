<p>There was never any doubt what my topic would be for this week’s blog. March Madness, right? Normally I’d be talking about the NCAA Basketball tournament, but not this time. Our March Madness is called Pwn2Own. We celebrated the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Pwn2Own in Vancouver this week with the biggest contest ever with 11 teams of contestants targeting products across four categories &#8211; 30 different attempts in total!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event is wrapping up later today but you can catch up (and keep up) with the latest through these blogs:</p>

<p><strong>Microsoft Patch Tuesday Update</strong></p>
<p>This week’s Digital Vaccine (DV) package includes coverage for the Microsoft Security Bulletins released on or before March 14, 2017. This month’s Patch Tuesday is the largest in Microsoft’s history, covering a whopping 135 CVEs (plus the bulletin for Flash, which addresses seven more CVEs) with 17 update bulletins – eight of them rated critical. The following table maps Digital Vaccine filters to the Microsoft Security Bulletins. Filters marked with an (*) shipped prior to this DV package, providing zero-day protection for our customers. You can get more detailed information on this month’s Microsoft Security Bulletins from Dustin Childs’ <a href="http://blog.trendmicro.com/march-2017-security-update-review/">March 2017 Security Update Review</a>:</p>
