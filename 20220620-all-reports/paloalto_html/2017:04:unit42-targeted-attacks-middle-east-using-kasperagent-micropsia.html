In addition, our research has uncovered evidence of links between attacks using these two new malware families and two families of Google Android malware we are calling SECUREUPDATE and VAMP.\n\nWe named the first new Microsoft Windows malware family \u201cKASPERAGENT\u201d based on strings we found in the malware. (Note that we DO NOT believe this is a reference to Kaspersky Lab). We named the second new Microsoft Windows malware family MICROPSIA because the malware is very tightly packed making it appear smaller than it is, similar to the human condition micropsia. We named the first new Google Android malware family SECUREUPDATE because it masks its malicious updates a secure updates. We named the second new Google Android malware family VAMP because it\u2019s focused on stealing data.\n\nThe attacks are not highly sophisticated, but the themes used, organizations and geographies targeted, as well the persistence of the attacker suggest a determined and noteworthy adversary. Some of this activity has been covered in a recent post by 360 security, however there is still a great deal of extra detail we are able to add in this report.\n\nStarting in March 2016, Palo Alto Networks began monitoring this threat following the successful prevention of the execution of a sample of the KASPERAGENT malware on a customer system, however the malware had likely already been used in attacks as early as July, 2015.\n\nAt the time of writing, we have uncovered:\n\n \t113 samples of the KASPERAGENT malware\n \t94 samples of the MICROPSIA malware\n \t17 samples of Android Malware which are related to this activity.\n \t39 command and control domains registered in relation to this activity\n\nMost of the attacks discovered so far target users in the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories, and Egypt; although there are occasional outliers. Notable outliers include media organizations in a variety of countries.\n\nThis post will begin by exploring how the attackers attempt to gain a foothold into target networks before briefly describing the malware families used.\nOne Bit.ly at a time\nThis group of attackers favors using URL shortening services to disguise the true links they are sending in spear phishing emails. In particular, a number of samples we analyzed were linked via the URL shortening service \"bit.ly\". The URL shortening service then redirects users to the malicious payload hosted on attacker controlled pages, with the malicious payload nearly always contained in an archive file (most commonly a RAR file.) Using the statistics provided by these link-shortening services, we can gain an immediate insight into the targets clicking these links:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The bit.ly statistics for a link to a dropper for the MICROPSIA malware family.\n\nThe statistics vary per link, suggesting different target audiences for different waves of spear phishing. For example, the statistics shown in Figure 1 the campaign targeted 113 users in Egypt, whereas in another example shown in Figure 2, Egypt did not make the top 3 countries targeted:\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The bit.ly statistics for another link to a copy of the MICROPSIA malware family\nFAKE NEWS!\nSending spear phishing emails with direct links to malicious shortened URLs was not the only method employed by the attackers to entice users to install the malware, another method favored by the attackers was the setting up of fake news sites.\u00a0 Figure 3 shows examples of pages created by the attackers to this end.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 3:\u00a0 Two fake new sites with links to shortened malicious URLs.\n\nWe are unable to confirm how traffic was driven to these sites, the attackers may have helped drive traffic via fake social media accounts, or they may have sent spear phishing links to these pages.\n\nMalware Analysis: MICROPSIA, KASPERAGENT and the missing link\nDuring our analysis, we discovered two distinct malware families which for the most part leveraged distinct infrastructure with no overlaps, initially leading us to categorize these campaigns separately. Later, we discovered a key link between the two sets of activity which leads us to believe they are related.\n\nThe MICROPSIA activity centers around domains registered using the email address adam.swift.2016@gmail[.]com \u2013 and no samples of KASPERAGENT talk to these domains. However, one of the domains (drive.acount-manager[.]net) registered by this address was used to host a sample (babf156ede8b5c2e6c961b6ffcccc5eb7a3d283b398370754061613f439d40f9) of KASPERAGENT, causing us to link the two sets of activity.\nKASPERAGENT\nWe have named the most common malware involved in this campaign, KASPERAGENT, due to PDB strings left behind in many samples of the malware. An example of a PDB string left behind is given below:\nc:\\Users\\USA\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2008\\Projects\\New folder (2)\\kasper\\Release\\kasper.pdb\n\nThis analysis is based on the following file:\n\nSHA256: babd654ef363e0645ce374dd9e2a42afe339c52f1cf17fc2285d8bebd3cfa11e\n\nThe file is compressed using the legitimate tool \"mpress.exe\" and once executed drops the payload to the directory C:\\vault\\igfxtray.exe which has the SHA256 hash f26caee34184b6a53ecbc0b5ce1f52e17d39af2129561dd6361fb4d4364e2c8b.\n\nThe malware also drops a decoy document containing Arabic names and ID numbers to the same folder and displays it to the user.\n\nKASPERAGENT is developed in Microsoft Visual C++ and attempts to disguise itself as a product that does not exist: \"Adobe Cinema Video Player\". The malware first establishes persistence using the classic method of adding a Run key, using the value \"MediaSystem\".\n\nThe malware connects to a C2 serverhosted on www.mailsinfo[.]net. The C2 server string in the binary is \"obfuscated\" in the most basic of senses, with the author adding '@'\u00a0 characters between letters and splitting the starting \"www.m\" to another string.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The Command and Control domain is obfuscated using a basic technique\n\nMost of the samples of KASPERAGENT use \"Chrome\" as the user agent, but this recent sample uses \"OPAERA\", possibly a misspelling of \u201cOpera\u201d, the browser.\n\nThe malware communicates with the C2 server via HTTP requests and in the most recent samples observed the callbacks are made to PHP scripts whose names relate to towns or navigation. Example URLs used include:\n\n \tGET request to \/dad5\/town.php\n \tPOST request to \/dad5\/addCity.php and \/dad5\/sign.php\n\nMost examples of the malware are nearly identical, and the malware simply acts as a basic reconnaissance tool and downloader for further payloads, however some examples of the malware include extended capabilities beyond that of a simple downloader. Examples of the extended-capability KASPERAGENT samples include:\n\n \ta52d3e65fe5bbf57bab79b1c5092b66d9650247249b72f667a927f266d09efe6\n \tc9ffb81a97a9458f1fc96f35cd187b1d7311479e77d031586abdc3d426da0859\n \t7f11e0bbc892a97b7c42416c43fe178ebb240939d9dee70c3c598305ce8a2d4f\n\nThese extended-capability samples connect to www.stikerscloud[.]com and implement the following additional functionality:\n\n \tTheft of passwords for Firefox and Chrome browsers\n \tTake screenshots\n \tRecording user keystrokes\n \tExfiltrate basic environment information such as the username and computer name\n \tPerform arbitrary commands\n \tEnumerate removable drives and copy files of interest to a new folder for exfiltration\n \tUpdate the malware to a new version\n \tExfilitrate arbitrary files (zip compressed and encrypted)\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that sometimes that both versions of the malware are wrapped in a Microsoft .NET Framework loader which is responsible for deploying the malware and displaying the decoy document. The author (imaginatively) calls this wrapper 'Loader' an example of this is the file is 4c1973278a30d1b4ce206eca63676624d234260758a0674d191d338a02914d23, which contains the PDB string: C:\\Users\\Yousef\\Desktop\\MergeFiles\\Loader v0\\Loader\\obj\\Release\\Loader.pdb\nMICROPSIA Analysis\nThe MICROPSIA malware family is written in Delphi and is an information stealing malware family with a wide range of data theft functionality built in. This analysis is based on the following sample:\n\nSHA256: 6e461a8430f251db38e8911dbacd1e72bce47a89c28956115b702d13ae2b8e3b\n\nWe named the malware MICROPSIA because of the way it is often packaged. The malware is often delivered as a RAR, which once extracted contains an EXE, which is further packed using UPX. Once unpacked from UPX, the next level is a further SFX RAR file, which then contains the actual malware files within. This effectively means the initial payload is extremely compressed and appears much smaller than it really is. The final payload contains four legitimate executables as resources:\n\n \tTwo embedded DLLs relating to the OpenSSL library used for traffic encryption.\n \tA copy of a command line version of WinRAR - used for encrypting and compressing the exfiltrated data\n \tThe file 'shortcut.exe' from optimumx.com (Creates, modifies or queries Windows shell links)\nthis is used for persistence by creating a link in the startup folder to the payload.\n\nThe malware begins execution by first copying itself to a predefined location, setting up persistence via an LNK file (hence the inclusion of the aforementioned shortcut.exe)\n\nThe main capabilities of the malware are as follows:\n\n \tLogging of keystrokes to a hardcoded text file and exfiltration to a remote server\n \tCapturing screenshots of the infected machines\n \tSearching for files with extensions matching Microsoft Office documents and using WinRAR to archive these prior to exfiltration. Example syntax of the command used is as follows:\n\n\"Rar.exe a -r -ep1 -v2500k -hpd58ccc009be55ff172a9039bf35cf270 -ta2016-12-11 ProgramData\\Recovery\\bin\\sys\\sysTime\\LMth_E E:\\*.xls E:\\*.doc\"\n\nThe value \u201cd58ccc009be55ff172a9039bf35cf27\u201d is used to encrypt exfiltrated documents and appears to be an MD5 hash, but we have not identified a string that maps to this hash.\nA side of phishing\nInterestingly in some cases the attackers combined an attempt to infect targeted users with malware, with an attempt to steal their credentials via traditional phishing techniques. The attackers sometimes directed users to sites spoofing legitimate services such as Google Drive to download the malware, however first the target users would be asked to fill in their credentials in, giving the attackers two chances to successfully steal target users\u2019 data (via the phish and via the eventual malware infection):\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 5: In some cases, users were required to fill in their credentials to download the malware\nAnd there's an APK twist...\nWhilst a large number of the domains associated with the adam.swift.2016@gmail[.]com email address are associated with MICROPSIA samples, some have been observed hosting Android apps or acting as C2 domains for Android malware samples. Analysis of these apps shows these are also malicious, and the apps also contain some social engineering tricks to enable installation.\n\nThere are two main APK malware families used by the threat actor. The first is a malware family used to gain a foothold on to the device, it is effectively a downloader with no additional functionality and we call this malware SECUREUPDATE.\n\n \n\nFigure 6: The applications often pretend to be social applications popular with end users.\n\nIn the sample we analyzed (6b4d65abf95cfb3cedd39b217ff0e4ee2229ae32aeda5170f34c5a3b9c5a0f3) the malware used the local calendar to sleep, creating an alarm in the future, at which point the malware would call back to receive an \u201cUpdate\u201d:\n\n\n\nFigure 7: The alarm functionality in the SECUREPDATE malware was used to download and execute a further payload at a later date.\n\nIn a similar vein to the \u2018a side of phishing\u2019 section, some of the versions of SECUREUPDATE backdoor attempt to steal credentials for users, making them create accounts for these fake apps in addition to the installation of the malware. This technique relies on credential re-use across many accounts but will still yield some success for the attackers:\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Some of the apps require users to \u201cLogin\u201d giving the attacker the chance to record credentials of victims that may well be reused elsewhere.\n\nThe second malware family is a malware family we call VAMP, which is already described in great detail in the blog by 360, VAMP is fully featured with all the capabilities you\u2019d expect from a malware family that resides on a phone. Features of the malware include:\n\n \tAbility to record calls\n \tContact theft\n \tTheft of documents stored on the device\n \tTheft of messages\n\nAnother outlier in terms of domains registered by adam.swift.2016@gmail[.]com\u00a0 is the domain AppPure[.]info. From the outset, the site appears to be a legitimate page:\n\n\n\nFigure 9: The app store created by the attackers which we believe was used to distribute malicious apps.\n\nAlthough we have been unable to find malicious content hosted on this site, we believe that it is very likely that amongst the many legitimate apps available for download via this store some malicious apps may exist.\nConcluding thoughts\nThrough this campaign there is little doubt that the attackers have been able to gain a great deal of information from their targets. We have been unable to uncover any evidence which allows us to confidently attribute this campaign to any known threat actor at present.\n\nThe scale of the campaign in terms of sheer numbers of samples and the maintenance of several differing malware families involved suggests a reasonably sized team and that the campaign is not being perpetrated by a lone wolf, but rather a small team attackers.\n\nThe campaign also illustrates that for some targets old tricks remain sufficient to run a successful espionage campaign, including use of URL shortening services, classic phishing techniques as well as using archive files to bypass some simple file checks.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are defended from this threat in the following ways:\n\n \tWildFire and Traps detect all of the malware discussed in this report as malicious.\n \tThe C2 domains listed in this report are blocked through Threat Prevention.\n \tAutoFocus customers can monitor this activity by looking at the tags:\n \tVAMP\n \tKASPERAGENT\n \tMICROPSIA\n \tSECUREUPDATE\n\nAppendix A \u2013 Associated C2

                    <p><em>This blog is the result of joint research between Unit 42 and Eyal Sela </em><a href="http://www.clearskysec.com/blog/"><em>ClearSky Cyber Security</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Over the past few months Palo Alto Networks have been working together with ClearSky on preventing and detecting targeted attacks in the Middle East using two relatively new Microsoft Windows malware families which we call KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA. In addition, our research has uncovered evidence of links between attacks using these two new malware families and two families of Google Android malware we are calling SECUREUPDATE and VAMP.</p>
<p>We named the first new Microsoft Windows malware family “KASPERAGENT” based on strings we found in the malware. (Note that we DO NOT believe this is a reference to Kaspersky Lab). We named the second new Microsoft Windows malware family MICROPSIA because the malware is very tightly packed making it appear smaller than it is, similar to the human condition <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropsia">micropsia</a>. We named the first new Google Android malware family SECUREUPDATE because it masks its malicious updates a secure updates. We named the second new Google Android malware family VAMP because it’s focused on stealing data.</p>
<p>The attacks are not highly sophisticated, but the themes used, organizations and geographies targeted, as well the persistence of the attacker suggest a determined and noteworthy adversary. Some of this activity has been covered in a recent post by <a href="http://zhuiri.360.cn/report/index.php/2017/03/09/twotailedscorpion">360 security</a>, however there is still a great deal of extra detail we are able to add in this report.</p>
<p>Starting in March 2016, Palo Alto Networks began monitoring this threat following the successful prevention of the execution of a sample of the KASPERAGENT malware on a customer system, however the malware had likely already been used in attacks as early as July, 2015.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, we have uncovered:</p>
<ul>
<li>113 samples of the KASPERAGENT malware</li>
<li>94 samples of the MICROPSIA malware</li>
<li>17 samples of Android Malware which are related to this activity.</li>
<li>39 command and control domains registered in relation to this activity</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the attacks discovered so far target users in the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories, and Egypt; although there are occasional outliers. Notable outliers include media organizations in a variety of countries.</p>
<p>This post will begin by exploring how the attackers attempt to gain a foothold into target networks before briefly describing the malware families used.</p>
<h3>One Bit.ly at a time</h3>
<p>This group of attackers favors using URL shortening services to disguise the true links they are sending in spear phishing emails. In particular, a number of samples we analyzed were linked via the URL shortening service &#8220;bit.ly&#8221;. The URL shortening service then redirects users to the malicious payload hosted on attacker controlled pages, with the malicious payload nearly always contained in an archive file (most commonly a RAR file.) Using the statistics provided by these link-shortening services, we can gain an immediate insight into the targets clicking these links:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26052" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig1.png" alt="fig1" width="637" height="439" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig1.png 637w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig1-300x207.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig1-370x255.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 1: The bit.ly statistics for a link to a dropper for the MICROPSIA malware family.</em></p>
<p>The statistics vary per link, suggesting different target audiences for different waves of spear phishing. For example, the statistics shown in <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> the campaign targeted 113 users in Egypt, whereas in another example shown in <strong>Figure 2</strong>, Egypt did not make the top 3 countries targeted:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26055" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig2.png" alt="fig2" width="566" height="414" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig2.png 566w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig2-300x219.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig2-370x271.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 2: The bit.ly statistics for another link to a copy of the MICROPSIA malware family</em></p>
<h3>FAKE NEWS!</h3>
<p>Sending spear phishing emails with direct links to malicious shortened URLs was not the only method employed by the attackers to entice users to install the malware, another method favored by the attackers was the setting up of fake news sites.  <strong>Figure 3</strong> shows examples of pages created by the attackers to this end.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26061" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig3a.png" alt="fig3a" width="979" height="742" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig3a.png 979w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig3a-900x682.png 900w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig3a-300x227.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig3a-768x582.png 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig3a-370x280.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26058" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig3b.png" alt="fig3b" width="979" height="950" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig3b.png 979w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig3b-900x873.png 900w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig3b-300x291.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig3b-768x745.png 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig3b-370x359.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 3:  Two fake new sites with links to shortened malicious URLs.</em></p>
<p>We are unable to confirm how traffic was driven to these sites, the attackers may have helped drive traffic via fake social media accounts, or they may have sent spear phishing links to these pages.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<h3>Malware Analysis: MICROPSIA, KASPERAGENT and the missing link</h3>
<p>During our analysis, we discovered two distinct malware families which for the most part leveraged distinct infrastructure with no overlaps, initially leading us to categorize these campaigns separately. Later, we discovered a key link between the two sets of activity which leads us to believe they are related.</p>
<p>The MICROPSIA activity centers around domains registered using the email address adam.swift.2016@gmail[.]com – and no samples of KASPERAGENT talk to these domains. However, one of the domains (drive.acount-manager[.]net) registered by this address was used to host a sample (babf156ede8b5c2e6c961b6ffcccc5eb7a3d283b398370754061613f439d40f9) of KASPERAGENT, causing us to link the two sets of activity.</p>
<h3>KASPERAGENT</h3>
<p>We have named the most common malware involved in this campaign, KASPERAGENT, due to PDB strings left behind in many samples of the malware. An example of a PDB string left behind is given below:</p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<p>This analysis is based on the following file:</p>
<p><strong>SHA256:</strong> babd654ef363e0645ce374dd9e2a42afe339c52f1cf17fc2285d8bebd3cfa11e</p>
<p>The file is compressed using the legitimate tool &#8220;mpress.exe&#8221; and once executed drops the payload to the directory C:\vault\igfxtray.exe which has the SHA256 hash f26caee34184b6a53ecbc0b5ce1f52e17d39af2129561dd6361fb4d4364e2c8b.</p>
<p>The malware also drops a decoy document containing Arabic names and ID numbers to the same folder and displays it to the user.</p>
<p>KASPERAGENT is developed in Microsoft Visual C++ and attempts to disguise itself as a product that does not exist: &#8220;Adobe Cinema Video Player&#8221;. The malware first establishes persistence using the classic method of adding a Run key, using the value &#8220;MediaSystem&#8221;.</p>
<p>The malware connects to a C2 serverhosted on www.mailsinfo[.]net. The C2 server string in the binary is &#8220;obfuscated&#8221; in the most basic of senses, with the author adding &#8216;@&#8217;  characters between letters and splitting the starting &#8220;www.m&#8221; to another string.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26064" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig4.png" alt="fig4" width="414" height="323" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig4.png 414w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig4-300x234.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig4-370x289.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 4: The Command and Control domain is obfuscated using a basic technique</em></p>
<p>Most of the samples of KASPERAGENT use &#8220;Chrome&#8221; as the user agent, but this recent sample uses &#8220;OPAERA&#8221;, possibly a misspelling of “Opera”, the browser.</p>
<p>The malware communicates with the C2 server via HTTP requests and in the most recent samples observed the callbacks are made to PHP scripts whose names relate to towns or navigation. Example URLs used include:</p>
<ul>
<li>GET request to /dad5/town.php</li>
<li>POST request to /dad5/addCity.php and /dad5/sign.php</li>
</ul>
<p>Most examples of the malware are nearly identical, and the malware simply acts as a basic reconnaissance tool and downloader for further payloads, however some examples of the malware include extended capabilities beyond that of a simple downloader. Examples of the extended-capability KASPERAGENT samples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a52d3e65fe5bbf57bab79b1c5092b66d9650247249b72f667a927f266d09efe6</li>

<li>7f11e0bbc892a97b7c42416c43fe178ebb240939d9dee70c3c598305ce8a2d4f</li>
</ul>
<p>These extended-capability samples connect to www.stikerscloud[.]com and implement the following additional functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theft of passwords for Firefox and Chrome browsers</li>
<li>Take screenshots</li>
<li>Recording user keystrokes</li>
<li>Exfiltrate basic environment information such as the username and computer name</li>
<li>Perform arbitrary commands</li>
<li>Enumerate removable drives and copy files of interest to a new folder for exfiltration</li>
<li>Update the malware to a new version</li>
<li>Exfilitrate arbitrary files (zip compressed and encrypted)</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth mentioning that sometimes that both versions of the malware are wrapped in a Microsoft .NET Framework loader which is responsible for deploying the malware and displaying the decoy document. The author (imaginatively) calls this wrapper &#8216;Loader&#8217; an example of this is the file is 4c1973278a30d1b4ce206eca63676624d234260758a0674d191d338a02914d23, which contains the PDB string: C:\Users\Yousef\Desktop\MergeFiles\Loader v0\Loader\obj\Release\Loader.pdb</p>
<h3>MICROPSIA Analysis</h3>
<p>The MICROPSIA malware family is written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)">Delphi</a> and is an information stealing malware family with a wide range of data theft functionality built in. This analysis is based on the following sample:</p>
<p>SHA256: 6e461a8430f251db38e8911dbacd1e72bce47a89c28956115b702d13ae2b8e3b</p>
<p>We named the malware MICROPSIA because of the way it is often packaged. The malware is often delivered as a RAR, which once extracted contains an EXE, which is further packed using UPX. Once unpacked from UPX, the next level is a further SFX RAR file, which then contains the actual malware files within. This effectively means the initial payload is extremely compressed and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropsia">appears much smaller than it really is.</a> The final payload contains four legitimate executables as resources:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two embedded DLLs relating to the OpenSSL library used for traffic encryption.</li>
<li>A copy of a command line version of WinRAR &#8211; used for encrypting and compressing the exfiltrated data</li>
<li>The file &#8216;shortcut.exe&#8217; from optimumx.com (Creates, modifies or queries Windows shell links)<br />
this is used for persistence by creating a link in the startup folder to the payload.</li>
</ol>
<p>The malware begins execution by first copying itself to a predefined location, setting up persistence via an LNK file (hence the inclusion of the aforementioned shortcut.exe)</p>
<p>The main capabilities of the malware are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logging of keystrokes to a hardcoded text file and exfiltration to a remote server</li>
<li>Capturing screenshots of the infected machines</li>
<li>Searching for files with extensions matching Microsoft Office documents and using WinRAR to archive these prior to exfiltration. Example syntax of the command used is as follows:</li>

<p>The value “d58ccc009be55ff172a9039bf35cf27” is used to encrypt exfiltrated documents and appears to be an MD5 hash, but we have not identified a string that maps to this hash.</p>
<h3>A side of phishing</h3>
<p>Interestingly in some cases the attackers combined an attempt to infect targeted users with malware, with an attempt to steal their credentials via traditional phishing techniques. The attackers sometimes directed users to sites spoofing legitimate services such as Google Drive to download the malware, however first the target users would be asked to fill in their credentials in, giving the attackers two chances to successfully steal target users’ data (via the phish and via the eventual malware infection):</p>

<p><em>Figure 5: In some cases, users were required to fill in their credentials to download the malware</em></p>
<h3>And there&#8217;s an APK twist&#8230;</h3>
<p>Whilst a large number of the domains associated with the adam.swift.2016@gmail[.]com email address are associated with MICROPSIA samples, some have been observed hosting Android apps or acting as C2 domains for Android malware samples. Analysis of these apps shows these are also malicious, and the apps also contain some social engineering tricks to enable installation.</p>
<p>There are two main APK malware families used by the threat actor. The first is a malware family used to gain a foothold on to the device, it is effectively a downloader with no additional functionality and we call this malware SECUREUPDATE.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26076" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig6a.png" alt="fig6a" width="494" height="422" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig6a.png 494w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig6a-300x256.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig6a-370x316.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26073" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig6b.png" alt="fig6b" width="347" height="469" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig6b.png 347w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig6b-222x300.png 222w" sizes="(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 6: The applications often pretend to be social applications popular with end users.</em></p>
<p>In the sample we analyzed (6b4d65abf95cfb3cedd39b217ff0e4ee2229ae32aeda5170f34c5a3b9c5a0f3) the malware used the local calendar to sleep, creating an alarm in the future, at which point the malware would call back to receive an “Update”:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26079" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig7.png" alt="fig7" width="970" height="189" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig7.png 970w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig7-900x175.png 900w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig7-300x58.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig7-768x150.png 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig7-370x72.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 7: The alarm functionality in the SECUREPDATE malware was used to download and execute a further payload at a later date.</em></p>
<p>In a similar vein to the ‘a side of phishing’ section, some of the versions of SECUREUPDATE backdoor attempt to steal credentials for users, making them create accounts for these fake apps in addition to the installation of the malware. This technique relies on credential re-use across many accounts but will still yield some success for the attackers:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26082" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig8.png" alt="fig8" width="519" height="358" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig8.png 519w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig8-300x207.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig8-370x255.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 8: Some of the apps require users to “Login” giving the attacker the chance to record credentials of victims that may well be reused elsewhere.</em></p>
<p>The second malware family is a malware family we call VAMP, which is already described <a href="https://ti.360.com/upload/report/file/APTSWXLVJ8fnjoxck.pdf">in great detail</a> in the blog by 360, VAMP is fully featured with all the capabilities you’d expect from a malware family that resides on a phone. Features of the malware include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to record calls</li>
<li>Contact theft</li>
<li>Theft of documents stored on the device</li>
<li>Theft of messages</li>
</ul>
<p>Another outlier in terms of domains registered by adam.swift.2016@gmail[.]com  is the domain AppPure[.]info. From the outset, the site appears to be a legitimate page:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26085" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig9.png" alt="fig9" width="886" height="404" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig9.png 886w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig9-300x137.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig9-768x350.png 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fig9-370x169.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 9: The app store created by the attackers which we believe was used to distribute malicious apps.</em></p>
<p>Although we have been unable to find malicious content hosted on this site, we believe that it is very likely that amongst the many legitimate apps available for download via this store some malicious apps may exist.</p>
<h3>Concluding thoughts</h3>
<p>Through this campaign there is little doubt that the attackers have been able to gain a great deal of information from their targets. We have been unable to uncover any evidence which allows us to confidently attribute this campaign to any known threat actor at present.</p>
<p>The scale of the campaign in terms of sheer numbers of samples and the maintenance of several differing malware families involved suggests a reasonably sized team and that the campaign is not being perpetrated by a lone wolf, but rather a small team attackers.</p>
<p>The campaign also illustrates that for some targets old tricks remain sufficient to run a successful espionage campaign, including use of URL shortening services, classic phishing techniques as well as using archive files to bypass some simple file checks.</p>
