One of the most common approaches is the use of spear phishing emails employing social engineering or commonly used exploits (such as CVE-2017-0199 or the ThreadKit builder) to trick the employees of organizations of interest. Once the initial infection has occurred is when the attacker becomes more sophisticated, deploying advanced custom pieces of malware, more advanced tools, and\/or using living-off-the land tools (such as the use of PowerShell, or tools like CMSTP or Regsvr32).\n\nThis approach makes it more difficult for threat hunters and defenders to find those needles in the haystack necessary to identify a campaign and its objectives.\u00a0 However even if an attacker uses commodity builders and tools, there is always a chance to find specific signals or characteristics that help to identify and track an actor\u2019s infrastructure. One of the groups well known for following these TTPs is the Cobalt Gang, which is still active even after the arrest of their alleged leader in Spain this year.\n\nDuring October 2018, Unit 42 has been investigating ongoing Cobalt Gang campaigns, as well as leveraging the latest information publicly reported in research reports, such as the ones described by Talos or Morphisec, to help discover and tie new infrastructure to this attack group.\n\nAs a result, we have been able to identify both the use of a common macro builder as well as specific document metadata which have allowed us to track and cluster new activity and infrastructure associated with the Cobalt Gang.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA Recent Effective Example of Delivery\n\nOne of the latest examples related to the campaign under analysis was used in attacks just a few days ago. It shows the simplicity of the attack delivery employed by this group.\n\nThe attack reinforces the fact that email is still one of the primary attack vectors we continuously observe. This attack begins by targeting employees at several banking entities across the globe using an email with subject \u201cConfirmations on October 16, 2018\u201d.\n\nThe sample shown in Figure 1 can already be found in popular public online malware repositories.\n\n(SHA256:\u00a0 5765ecb239833e5a4b2441e3a2daf3513356d45e1d5c311baeb31f4d503703e).\n\n\nFigure 1. Example of Email delivery\n&nbsp;\n\nThe attachment is just a PDF document without any kind of code or exploit. Instead it seeks to use social engineering to convince the user click a link to download a malicious macro. This is a method used before by the Cobalt Gang and discussed in previous research as for example by Talos.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFigure 2. PDF sample with embedded link\n&nbsp;\n\nThe PDF is simple and embeds a link that will open a legitimate Google location, and redirect the browser to a malicious document from there:\n\n\nFigure 3. Malicious doc browser redirect\nIn order to be effective against static analysis tools, the PDF that attackers crafted the PDF to seem more authentic: it contains empty pages as well as some text pages that help in not raising red flags during analysis, shown in Figures 4 and 5. Keep in mind that PDFs with low number of pages or high entropy in the content can raise suspicious flags in static analysis.\n\n\nFigure 4. PDF static analysis\n\nFigure 5. PDF text used to fill pages\n&nbsp;\n\nBy employing these two techniques the PDF avoids almost all traditional AV detection, resulting in a very effective transport of the first stage of the attack via email.\n\nIf the attack progresses, the user will be taken to the download of an MS Word document containing malicious macros that has very low detection rate at the moment of this campaign delivery. From a metadata standpoint, the document does not include any specific signal or characteristic that would help us tracking documents from the same author, as shown in Figure 6.\n\n\nFigure 6. Doc102018.doc metadata\nThe downloaded malicious macro uses cmstp.exe to run a \u201cscriptlet\u201d, a technique well known to bypass AppLocker, and continues with the next stages of the payload delivery.\u00a0 The objective of this research is not the payload analysis, but to focus on all possible aspects of the attack delivery for further tracking on the actors\u2019 campaign and its associated infrastructure.\n\nSo, the question is now\u2026 how can this simple delivery method help identify the campaign and objectives?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMacro Builder Identification\n\nThe attack also achieves quite low detection results with its macro code, so one of the first focuses of the investigation is the identification of a possible underlying builder. By looking into the macro code for \u201cDoc102018.doc\u201d, we can posit multiple theories.\n\nThe macro code is over 1500 lines in length, and starts declaring a set of variables with a very specific nomenclature (in this sample, letXX(num)):\n\n\nFigure 7. Example of format of macro variables\nSome of the variables are used in long encoding \/ decoding routines based on individual character assignations:\n\n\nFigure 8. Using specific variable format in decoding routines\nProcedures and functions are also defined using the same nomenclature (in this sample, letXX()):\n\n\nFigure 9. Procedures and Functions in VBA code \n&nbsp;\n\nAnd it makes use of the API call \u201cCallByName\u201d to invoke methods at runtime:\n\n\nFigure 10. Use of CallByName in VBA code\nIf we analyze some previous samples linked to Cobalt Gang, such as the ones depicted by Morphisec, this pattern is also observable (in this case, using PkXX instead of letXX):\n\n\nFigure 11. VBA pattern in other documents\nOne initial approach to hunt for the pattern can be based on the following regular expressions for the different areas:\n\n\n\nVariable definitions \/[A-Za-z]k[0-9]{2}([0-9]{1})\/\n\nFunction definitions \/Private Function [A-Za-z]{2,5}[0-9]{2,3}\\(\/\n\nProcedure definitions \/Sub [A-Za-z]{2,5}[0-9]{2,5}\\(\/\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn order to test our hypothesis for the builder we created the following Yara rules:\nrule cmstp_macro_builder_rev_a\n{\n    meta:\n        description=\"CMSTP macro builder based on variable names and runtime invoke\"\n        author=\"Palo Alto Networks Unit42\"\n    strings:\n        $method=\"CallByName\"\n        $varexp=\/[A-Za-z]k[0-9]{2}([0-9]{1})\/\n    condition:\n        $method and\n        #method == 2 and\n        #varexp &gt; 10\n \n}\n \nrule cmstp_macro_builder_rev_b {\n    meta:\n        description=\"CMSTP macro builder based on routines and functions names and runtime invoke\"\n        author=\"Palo Alto Networks Unit42\"\n    strings:\n        $func=\/Private Function [A-Za-z]{1,5}[0-9]{2,3}\\(\/\n        $sub=\/Sub [A-Za-z]{1,5}[0-9]{2,5}\\(\/\n        $call=\"CallByName\"\n    condition:\n        $call and\n        #func &gt; 1 and\n        #sub &gt; 1\n}\n\nHunting with these Yara rules leads to very positive results identifying this builder as well as a set of malicious documents using it. But the documents identified are not always targeting the finance or banking industries, and so, we cannot guarantee that this builder is only used by this specific Cobalt Gang group and its campaigns against those industries.\n\nHowever, using this in combination with other aspects such as the target, payload, or dropper characteristics, becomes very useful in tracking this group\u2019s campaigns, as we will see in the following sections.\n\nLet\u2019s focus then on the first stage of the delivery, the PDF documents.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCommon Signals in PDF Documents\n\nAs we have seen, the use of a commodity PDF file with an embedded Google redirect link results in a very effective social engineering artifact. As there is no exploit or code executed, our research will now be focused on the metadata information from the document for further analysis.\n\n\nFigure 12. PDF Exiftool metadata\n&nbsp;\n\nOur next hypothesis would be to check if the PDF documents could have been created based on a template document, where the author modifies the embedded link in the PDF and saves different document versions over time.\n\nBased on the XMP specification, we will pay attention to the values of the \u201cDocumentID\u201d and \u201cInstanceID\u201d Media Management Properties:\n\n\nFigure 13. XMP Media Management Properties\nIn order to confirm this hypothesis, let\u2019s focus on the Document ID metadata field. Basically, saving the same template twice with 2 different links would produce the same Document ID but multiple Instance ID values (one per saved document).\n\nSearching our telemetry data for this metadata content produces interesting results.\n\nIn order to help hunting for the content, the following Yara rule also could be used:\nrule cobaltgang_pdf_metadata_rev_a{\n    meta:\n        description=\"Find documents saved from the same potential Cobalt Gang PDF template\"\n        author=\"Palo Alto Networks Unit 42\"\n    strings:\n             $ = \"&lt;xmpMM:DocumentID&gt;uuid:31ac3688-619c-4fd4-8e3f-e59d0354a338\" ascii wide\n    condition:\n             any of them\n}\n\nThe results confirm our hypothesis (see Appendix for IOCs), and we have been able to find multiple PDF files that the attacker has saved with different contents but starting on the same \u201ctemplate\u201d, all of them sharing the same characteristics.\n\n(different content)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFigure 14. Example PDF document\n&nbsp;\n\nFurther analysis on the subsequent stages of the attack will allow us to confirm if the samples are related to Cobalt Gang campaigns.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s analyze the following document:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nObserved File Name\nSHA256\n\n\nREMITTER REFERENCE PMT.pdf\n1d0aae6cff1f7a772fac67b74a39904b8b9da46484b4ae8b621a6566f7761d16\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe document was delivered by email, with the subject \u201cFund Transfer 08-October-2018\", targeting banking customers:\n\n\nFigure 15. Email data associated to REMITTER REFERENCE PMT.pdf\nAnd it contains the embedded link redirecting to the following URL:\n\n\n\nhxxps:\/\/fundswp[.]com\/Document082018.doc\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhich downloads the document:\n\n\n\nObserved File Name\nSHA256\n\n\nDocument082018.doc\n020ba5a273c0992d62faa05144aed7f174af64c836bf82009ada46f1ce3b6eee\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBy extracting the macro code, we can validate how it matches the macro builder described in the previous section. The following output shows how running the Yara rule searching for the macro builder against the extracted VBA contents of the document produces the expected match in its contents:\n\u276f yara cmstp_macro_builder.yar 020ba5a273c0992d62faa05144aed7f174af64c836bf82009ada46f1ce3b6eee_subfiles\n\ncmstp_macro_builder_2 \n020ba5a273c0992d62faa05144aed7f174af64c836bf82009ada46f1ce3b6eee_subfiles\/e657fe761effbe7e11e3cc343ba6845c2c9a6c989e7b805717d2e1417387528f.vba.decoded\n\ncmstp_macro_builder_2 \n020ba5a273c0992d62faa05144aed7f174af64c836bf82009ada46f1ce3b6eee_subfiles\/8a6d2cccb6f2007cb7fa29d3f009f9fbe305bffc45dc35d3828f2dc3c41b3cb7.vba.raw\n\nThe pieces of our puzzle start to match for this campaign if we now put things in perspective:\n\n \tHunting for PDF files that are created with the same \u201cDocumentID\u201d management metadata field result in a set of files that have been used in email delivery against banking entities.\n \tAll of the PDF files embed a link based on a Google redirect, leading to the download of a Microsoft Office document file.\n \tThe Microsoft Office document files contain macros for code execution. Those macros match the characteristics of the builder that we have characterized.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDiscovering the Attacker\u2019s Infrastructure\n\nWith these results obtained, we can start to move towards finding attacker infrastructure pieces based on multiple aspects, such as the hunting rules defined in previous sections, session data obtained by our telemetry, or public WHOIS registrar data.\n\n\nUsing our \u201chunting rules\u201d\n\nBased on the metadata and builder characteristics, we have tracked a set of malicious PDF and Office files (see Appendix) that provide us with domains and Office files in use by the attacker.\n\nSome examples of the PDF and embedded C2 links and document names are below in Table 1:\n\n\n\nSHA256\nEmbedded Link\n\n\n1fd9ba8eb97bf03cd4d3cbaac867595c920f1f36ebfbe9c1fc76558ea5e0ece5\nhxxp:\/\/www[.]pedidoslalacteo[.]com[.]ar\/Proof-of-payment-19.09.2018.doc\n\n\n5ac1612535b6981259cfac95efe84c5608cf51e3a49b9c1e00c5d374f90d10b2\nhxxps:\/\/s3[.]sovereigncars[.]org[.]uk\/inv005189.pdf\n\n\n07f60611836c0a679c0fb2e25f5caeb4d29cd970919d47f715666b80be46f45c\nhxxps:\/\/alotile[.]biz\/Document092018.doc\n\n\n9d6fd7239e1baac696c001cabedfeb72cf0c26991831819c3124a0a726e8fe23\nhxxps:\/\/goo[.]gl\/mn7iGj\n\nWhich redirects to: hxxps:\/\/document[.]cdn-one[.]biz\/doc000512.pdf\n\n\n444c63bb794abe3d2b524e0cb2c8dcc174279b23b1bce949a7125df9fab25c1c\nhxxps:\/\/safesecurefiles[.]com\/doc041791.pdf\n\n\na5f2ad08b5afdbd5317b51d0d2dd8f781903522844c786a11a0957a81abfd29e\n\n&nbsp;\nhxxp:\/\/www[.]mky[.]com\/Proof-of-payment-19.09.2018.doc\n\n\ndf18e997a2f755159f0753c4e69a45764f746657b782f6d3c878afb8befe2b69\nhxxps:\/\/mail[.]halcyonih[.]com\/uploads\/doc004718538.pdf\n\n\n\nTable 1. Example PDF and embedded links\n&nbsp;\n\nThe PDF documents and URLs allowed us to discover multiple overlaps between this new infrastructure and the existing knowledge about Cobalt Gang attributed activity in previous research, corroborating new infrastructure belonging to the same attacker.\n\nLet\u2019s see a couple of examples of PDF documents from the list which belong to the same Document ID.\n\n\n\nObserved File Name\nSHA256\n\n\ninv005189.pdf\n5ac1612535b6981259cfac95efe84c5608cf51e3a49b9c1e00c5d374f90d10b2\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis sample has been already documented in previous campaigns, being related to s3[.]sovereigncars[.]org[.]uk domain. See the Talos blog.\n\n\n\nObserved File Name\nSHA256\n\n\ndoc000512.pdf\n9d6fd7239e1baac696c001cabedfeb72cf0c26991831819c3124a0a726e8fe23\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe sample embeds the URL hxxps:\/\/goo[.]gl\/mn7iGj which is actually a shortened URL resolving to hxxps:\/\/document[.]cdn-one[.]biz\/doc000512.pdf.\n\nDomain cdn-one[.]biz is a well-known Cobalt Gang attributed domain in previous analysis.\n\nThe complete list of domains used by the PDF identified can be found in the Appendix section.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPivoting on Email Sender Telemetry\n\nBased on email delivery data, our telemetry helps us collecting samples related and indicators related to the campaign.\n\nLet\u2019s put a simple example of how tracking session data lead us to new infrastructure, by using some of the email sender data that is identified in malicious email sessions sending the PDF documents.\n\nFor example, the following senders belong to the recent campaign and are spoofing both legitimate email domains and senders:\n\n\n\ndominique.denis-berube.1@ulaval.ca\n\n\nbillb@verticalwebmedia.combillb@verticalwebmedia.com\n\n\nbenoit.filion.2@ulaval.cabenoit.filion.2@ulaval.ca\n\n\ndominique.denis-berube.1@ulaval.ca\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSome of the samples delivered by these senders and their embedded links are shown below in Table 2:\n\n\n\nSHA256\nEmbedded link\n\n\n1c1a6bb0937c454eb397495eea034e00d1f7cf4e77481a04439afbc5b3503396\nhxxps:\/\/alotile.biz\/Document092018.doc\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n187e0d911cd0393caad1364ded1c394257cd149898b31f9718c7c6319af79818\n\n&nbsp;\nhxxps:\/\/alotile.biz\/Document042018.doc\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n988d430ce0e9f19634cf7955eac6eb03e3b7774b788010c2a9742b38016d1ebf\nhxxps:\/\/fundsxe.com\/Document09202018.doc\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n852f11e5131d3dab9812fd8ce3cd94c1333904f38713ff959f980a168ef0d4ce\nhxxps:\/\/fundsxe.com\/Document09222018.doc\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTable 2.

Summary of relations and overlaps.\n&nbsp;\n\nAs it can be observed in the different clusters of activity:\n\n \tThe initial cluster of PDF documents, on the left, links to specific domains for the download of Microsoft Office files using the macro builder structure.\n \tSome of the domains in use are publicly registered with the name of \u201cgrigoredanbanescu\u201d and allow us to find other related domains, which are already linked to previous Cobalt Gang activity.\n \tSome of the initial PDFs have relations with Microsoft Office files linked to \u201cgrigoredanbanescu\u201d activity, confirming again the relationships.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nConclusion\n\nCommodity attacks are widely used for both criminal and more targeted attacks, making identification difficult for networks defenders and threat hunters. One actor that makes extensive use of this approach to compromise victims is the Cobalt Gang.\n\nBy focusing on specific aspects of the macro builders and metadata the actors left behind we were able to develop new mechanisms to track and hunt Cobalt Gang activity and infrastructure.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected in the following ways:\n\n \tWildFire detects malware samples used by this campaign.\n \tTraps prevents these attacks at the endpoint.\n \tAll involved malicious domains have been covered by PAN-DB URL Filtering.\n \tAn Autofocus tag has been created for tracking CobaltGang actor group.\n\nAppendix \u2013 Indicators of Compromise\n\nInitial example

One of the most common approaches is the use of spear phishing emails employing social engineering or commonly used exploits (such as <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-0199">CVE-2017-0199</a> or the <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/unraveling-ThreadKit-new-document-exploit-builder-distribute-The-Trick-Formbook-Loki-Bot-malware">ThreadKit builder</a>) to trick the employees of organizations of interest. Once the initial infection has occurred is when the attacker becomes more sophisticated, deploying advanced custom pieces of malware, more advanced tools, and/or using living-off-the land tools (such as the use of PowerShell, or tools like <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1191">CMSTP</a> or <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1117">Regsvr32</a>).</p>
<p>This approach makes it more difficult for threat hunters and defenders to find those needles in the haystack necessary to identify a campaign and its objectives.  However even if an attacker uses commodity builders and tools, there is always a chance to find specific signals or characteristics that help to identify and track an actor’s infrastructure. One of the groups well known for following these TTPs is the Cobalt Gang, which is still active even after the <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/mastermind-behind-eur-1-billion-cyber-bank-robbery-arrested-in-spain">arrest</a> of their alleged leader in Spain this year.</p>
<p>During October 2018, Unit 42 has been investigating ongoing Cobalt Gang campaigns, as well as leveraging the latest information publicly reported in research reports, such as the ones described by <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/07/multiple-cobalt-personality-disorder.html">Talos</a> or <a href="https://blog.morphisec.com/cobalt-gang-2.0">Morphisec</a>, to help discover and tie new infrastructure to this attack group.</p>
<p>As a result, we have been able to identify both the use of a common macro builder as well as specific document metadata which have allowed us to track and cluster new activity and infrastructure associated with the Cobalt Gang.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">A Recent Effective Example of Delivery</span></p>
<p>One of the latest examples related to the campaign under analysis was used in attacks just a few days ago. It shows the simplicity of the attack delivery employed by this group.</p>
<p>The attack reinforces the fact that email is still one of the primary attack vectors we continuously observe. This attack begins by targeting employees at several banking entities across the globe using an email with subject “Confirmations on October 16, 2018”.</p>
<p>The sample shown in Figure 1 can already be found in popular public online malware repositories.</p>
<p>(SHA256:  5765ecb239833e5a4b2441e3a2daf3513356d45e1d5c311baeb31f4d503703e).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-93685" src="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cobalt_1.png" alt="" width="600" height="493" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 1. Example of Email delivery</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attachment is just a PDF document without any kind of code or exploit. Instead it seeks to use social engineering to convince the user click a link to download a malicious macro. This is a method used before by the Cobalt Gang and discussed in previous research as for example by <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/07/multiple-cobalt-personality-disorder.html">Talos</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-93698" src="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cobalt_2.png" alt="" width="600" height="208" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 2. PDF sample with embedded link</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PDF is simple and embeds a link that will open a legitimate Google location, and redirect the browser to a malicious document from there:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-93711" src="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cobalt_3.png" alt="" width="600" height="110" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 3. Malicious doc browser redirect</em></p>
<p>In order to be effective against static analysis tools, the PDF that attackers crafted the PDF to seem more authentic: it contains empty pages as well as some text pages that help in not raising red flags during analysis, shown in Figures 4 and 5. Keep in mind that PDFs with low number of pages or high entropy in the content can raise suspicious flags in static analysis.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-93724" src="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cobalt_4.png" alt="" width="600" height="203" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 4. PDF static analysis</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-93737" src="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cobalt_5.png" alt="" width="600" height="582" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 5. PDF text used to fill pages</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By employing these two techniques the PDF avoids almost all traditional AV detection, resulting in a very effective transport of the first stage of the attack via email.</p>
<p>If the attack progresses, the user will be taken to the download of an MS Word document containing malicious macros that has very low detection rate at the moment of this campaign delivery. From a metadata standpoint, the document does not include any specific signal or characteristic that would help us tracking documents from the same author, as shown in Figure 6.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-93750 aligncenter" src="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cobalt_6.png" alt="" width="647" height="656" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 6. Doc102018.doc metadata</em></p>
<p>The downloaded malicious macro uses cmstp.exe to run a “scriptlet”, a technique well known to <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1191">bypass AppLocker</a>, and continues with the next stages of the payload delivery.  The objective of this research is not the payload analysis, but to focus on all possible aspects of the attack delivery for further tracking on the actors’ campaign and its associated infrastructure.</p>
<p>So, the question is now… how can this simple delivery method help identify the campaign and objectives?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Macro Builder Identification</span></p>
<p>The attack also achieves quite low detection results with its macro code, so one of the first focuses of the investigation is the identification of a possible underlying builder. By looking into the macro code for “Doc102018.doc”, we can posit multiple theories.</p>
<p>The macro code is over 1500 lines in length, and starts declaring a set of variables with a very specific nomenclature (in this sample, letXX(num)):</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-93763" src="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cobalt_7.png" alt="" width="600" height="40" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 7. Example of format of macro variables</em></p>
<p>Some of the variables are used in long encoding / decoding routines based on individual character assignations:</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-93776 aligncenter" src="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cobalt_8.png" alt="" width="314" height="343" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 8. Using specific variable format in decoding routines</em></p>
<p>Procedures and functions are also defined using the same nomenclature (in this sample, letXX()):</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-93789" src="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cobalt_9.png" alt="" width="600" height="320" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 9. Procedures and Functions in VBA code </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it makes use of the API call “CallByName” to invoke methods at runtime:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-93802" src="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cobalt_10.png" alt="" width="600" height="78" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 10. Use of CallByName in VBA code</em></p>
<p>If we analyze some previous samples linked to Cobalt Gang, such as the ones depicted by <a href="https://blog.morphisec.com/cobalt-gang-2.0">Morphisec</a>, this pattern is also observable (in this case, using PkXX instead of letXX):</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-93815" src="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cobalt_11.png" alt="" width="600" height="314" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 11. VBA pattern in other documents</em></p>
<p>One initial approach to hunt for the pattern can be based on the following regular expressions for the different areas:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="624">Variable definitions <strong>/[A-Za-z]k[0-9]{2}([0-9]{1})/</strong></p>
<p>Function definitions <strong>/Private Function [A-Za-z]{2,5}[0-9]{2,3}\(/</strong></p>
<p>Procedure definitions <strong>/Sub [A-Za-z]{2,5}[0-9]{2,5}\(/</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hunting with these Yara rules leads to very positive results identifying this builder as well as a set of malicious documents using it. But the documents identified are not always targeting the finance or banking industries, and so, we cannot guarantee that this builder is only used by this specific Cobalt Gang group and its campaigns against those industries.</p>
<p>However, using this in combination with other aspects such as the target, payload, or dropper characteristics, becomes very useful in tracking this group’s campaigns, as we will see in the following sections.</p>
<p>Let’s focus then on the first stage of the delivery, the PDF documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Common Signals in PDF Documents</span></p>
<p>As we have seen, the use of a commodity PDF file with an embedded Google redirect link results in a very effective social engineering artifact. As there is no exploit or code executed, our research will now be focused on the metadata information from the document for further analysis.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-93828" src="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cobalt_12.png" alt="" width="600" height="410" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 12. PDF Exiftool metadata</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our next hypothesis would be to check if the PDF documents could have been created based on a template document, where the author modifies the embedded link in the PDF and saves different document versions over time.</p>
<p>Based on the <a href="https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/xmp/pdfs/XMP%20SDK%20Release%20cc-2016-08/XMPSpecificationPart1.pdf">XMP specification</a>, we will pay attention to the values of the “DocumentID” and “InstanceID” Media Management Properties:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-93841" src="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cobalt_13.png" alt="" width="600" height="248" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 13. XMP Media Management Properties</em></p>
<p>In order to confirm this hypothesis, let’s focus on the Document ID metadata field. Basically, saving the same template twice with 2 different links would produce the same Document ID but multiple Instance ID values (one per saved document).</p>
<p>Searching our telemetry data for this metadata content produces interesting results.</p>
<p>In order to help hunting for the content, the following Yara rule also could be used:</p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<p>The pieces of our puzzle start to match for this campaign if we now put things in perspective:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hunting for PDF files that are created with the same “DocumentID” management metadata field result in a set of files that have been used in email delivery against banking entities.</li>
<li>All of the PDF files embed a link based on a Google redirect, leading to the download of a Microsoft Office document file.</li>
<li>The Microsoft Office document files contain macros for code execution. Those macros match the characteristics of the builder that we have characterized.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Discovering the Attacker’s Infrastructure</span></p>
<p>With these results obtained, we can start to move towards finding attacker infrastructure pieces based on multiple aspects, such as the hunting rules defined in previous sections, session data obtained by our telemetry, or public WHOIS registrar data.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Using our “hunting rules”</strong></p>
<p>Based on the metadata and builder characteristics, we have tracked a set of malicious PDF and Office files (see Appendix) that provide us with domains and Office files in use by the attacker.</p>
<p>Some examples of the PDF and embedded C2 links and document names are below in Table 1:</p>

<p><strong>Pivoting on Email Sender Telemetry</strong></p>
<p>Based on email delivery data, our telemetry helps us collecting samples related and indicators related to the campaign.</p>
<p>Let’s put a simple example of how tracking session data lead us to new infrastructure, by using some of the email sender data that is identified in malicious email sessions sending the PDF documents.</p>
<p>For example, the following senders belong to the recent campaign and are spoofing both legitimate email domains and senders:</p>

<p>Many of the domains listed are already known as malicious domains attributed to other Cobalt Gang campaigns.</p>
<p>As an important note “arubrabank[.]com” is a new domain registered on 2019-09-18 and still not observed in an active campaign.</p>
<p>The domain seems to be intended to mimic the legitimate Arubabank website for further activity:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-93893" src="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cobalt_17.png" alt="" width="600" height="216" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 17. Arubabank legitimate site</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Infrastructure Relationships</span></p>
<p>Let’s summarize all the pieces of our puzzle, now that we can put together all the relationships we observed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-93906" src="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cobalt_18.png" alt="" width="600" height="363" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 18. Maltego graph. Summary of relations and overlaps.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it can be observed in the different clusters of activity:</p>
<ol>
<li>The initial cluster of PDF documents, on the left, links to specific domains for the download of Microsoft Office files using the macro builder structure.</li>
<li>Some of the domains in use are publicly registered with the name of “grigoredanbanescu” and allow us to find other related domains, which are already linked to previous Cobalt Gang activity.</li>
<li>Some of the initial PDFs have relations with Microsoft Office files linked to “grigoredanbanescu” activity, confirming again the relationships.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p>Commodity attacks are widely used for both criminal and more targeted attacks, making identification difficult for networks defenders and threat hunters. One actor that makes extensive use of this approach to compromise victims is the Cobalt Gang.</p>
<p>By focusing on specific aspects of the macro builders and metadata the actors left behind we were able to develop new mechanisms to track and hunt Cobalt Gang activity and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Palo Alto Networks customers are protected in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>WildFire detects malware samples used by this campaign.</li>
<li>Traps prevents these attacks at the endpoint.</li>
<li>All involved malicious domains have been covered by PAN-DB URL Filtering.</li>
<li>An Autofocus tag has been created for tracking <a href="https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.CobaltGang">CobaltGang</a> actor group.</li>
