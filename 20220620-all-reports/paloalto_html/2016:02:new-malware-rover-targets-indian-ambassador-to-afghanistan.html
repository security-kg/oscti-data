The body and content of the email suggest that it was crafted and spoofed to look like it was sent by the current Defence Minister of India, Mr. Manohar Parrikar, commending the Ambassador on his contributions and success.\n\nIndia has been a key nation in building and funding Afghanistan\u2019s infrastructure and economic development, which includes setting up iron ore mines, steel plants, power plants and transportation systems, helping reconstruct the Salma Dam and constructing a new Parliament Complex for the Afghan Government.\n\nGiven India\u2019s significant contributions to the development of Afghanistan, it is likely that there may be groups or nations who would be interested in tracking and spying on key individuals who officially represent India in Afghanistan.\nOverview of Rover infection\nFigure 1 gives an overview of the exploitation, infection and C2 communications of the 'Rover' Trojan campaign targeting a victim running Windows XP.\n\n\nFigure 1: Overview\u00a0of the infection flow and C2 communications\nRover Trojan Infection Steps:\n\n \tRTF file exploits CVE-2010-3333 and downloads an executable from newsumbrella[.]net.\n\n\n \tThe executable file downloaded from\u00a0newsumbrella[.]net\u00a0is executed on the victim machine.\n\n\n \tThe executable 'file.exe' is a downloader which is used to call out to a server with the IP '46.166.165.254' and download the main Rover malware along with plugins used by the Rover malware.\n\n\n \tRover malware and plugins are downloaded and installed on the victim machine.\n\n\n \tData exfiltrated from the victim machine.\n\nTargeting and Infection\nFigure 2 shows an email which was sent to the Ambassador of India, appearing to commend the contributions the Ambassador has made in the development and success of projects on national interest, and attaching a letter of appreciation with a file name, \u201cAppreciation_letter.doc\u201d.\n\nThe attachment is an RTF file which exploits a specific vulnerability in Microsoft Word, CVE-2010-3333.\n\n\n\u00a0Figure 2: Spear phishing email sent to the Ambassador of Afghanistan\nIf the recipient of the e-mail opened the attachment in a vulnerable version of Word, the exploit code would download and execute a file from the domain newsumbrella[.]net as shown in Figure 3 below.\n\n\nFigure 3: Hexdump showing the domain and the executable downloaded\n\nMalware Analysis\nDuring the time of analysis the executable file systemupdateAPI.exe was no longer being hosted on the newsumbrealla[.]net domain. However, we have noticed the same domain hosting another executable in the past within the same parent directory and having a similar naming for the folders as shown below\n\nnewsumbrella[.]net\/ne3s\/lat3st\/w0rld\/systemupdateAPI[.]exe\n\nnewsumbrella[.]net\/ne3s\/file[.]exe \u2013 hosted earlier\n\nWe believe that the executables hosted under the parent directory \u2018ne3s\u2019 are variants of the same downloader Trojan, which was used to download the Rover Trojan. The file, file.exe, contains the following debug information that indicates the file was originally named systemupdateAPI.exe.\n\n\nFigure 4: Debug information of downloader program\nBy analyzing file.exe, we can see that it is a downloader, which creates \u2018c:\\system\u2019 directory and depending on the OS version used, downloads the main Rover payload along with multiple DLL modules from 46.166.165.254.\n\nFigure 5: Code snippet showing the OS version check and the subsequent download from 46.166.165.254\nIf the infected system is running an OS version prior to Windows Vista, it would download the following files from 46.166.165.254:\n\n \tWindowsSecurityService2.exe ('Rover' main module)\n \tOpenal32.dll\n \tCxcore210.dll (OpenCV)\n \tHighgui210.dll (OpenCV)\n \tlibsndfile-1.dll\n\nIf the OS version is Windows Vista or later, it would download the following files from 46.166.165.254 :\n\n \tWindowsSecurityService3.exe ('Rover' main module)\n \tOpenAL32.dll\n \topencv_world300.dll\n \tmsvcp100.dll\n \tmsvcp110.dll\n \tmsvcp120.dll\n \tmsvcr100.dll\n \tmsvcr110.dll\n \tmsvcr120.dll\n\nAfter retrieving these files, the downloader Trojan executes the main module. Even though the main modules use different library versions, the functionality of the backdoors are identical.\n\nBy analyzing the files downloaded to the victim machine, we can see that the executable WindowsSecurityService2.exe imports the four DLL files that were downloaded to the same directory. The four DDLs are cxcore210.dll, highgui210.dll, OpenAL32.dll and libsndfile-1.dll as shown in Figure 6\n\nFigure 6: Executable and DLLs downloaded to the victim machine\nAttributes of the Rover variant\n\n##############################################\n\nFile: WindowsSecurityService2.exe\n\n##############################################\n\nMeta-data\n\n===============================================\n\nSize\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 : 337920 bytes\nType\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 : PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\nArchitecture\u00a0 : 32 Bits binary\nMD5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 : 76429f8515768f9f5def697e71071f51\nSHA1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 : d04ce934561934f758d77dfa944bd6743dd82cff\nSHA256: 7757517ae6b4d513a57826f9ab65bd070d99d25ac526cfae3e9955c3c7cd457assdeep\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 : 6144:JabBRNUKgZ9SN0jzoFBB9hcrpXwg9xXYOGl93XO2rQLfbTpLuO7bIWjRO5gjPNq:JarSKu6yzoF8rpAqXYv3XOgQLfnpLuOu\nimphash\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 : b5aa366f452feb9f4dff3c72157ca1f9\nDate\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 : 0x5637227B [Mon Nov 2 08:44:43 2015 UTC]\nLanguage\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 : ENGLISH\nCRC:\u00a0\u00a0 (Claimed) : 0x59736, (Actual): 0x59736\nEntry Point\u00a0\u00a0 : 0x43e3c8 .text 0\/5\n\n===============================================\n\nImports\n\n===============================================\n\n[1] ADVAPI32.dll\n[2] WS2_32.dll\n[3] WLDAP32.dll\n[4] cxcore210.dll (OpenCV module)\n[5] highgui210.dll (OpenCV module)\n[6] OpenAL32.dll\n[7] libsndfile-1.dll\n[8] GDI32.dll\n[9] KERNEL32.dll\n[10] USER32.dll\n[11] MSVCP90.dll\n[12] RPCRT4.dll\n[13] MSVCR90.dll\n\nThe author of 'Rover' used the following open source projects to implement the main functionalities of this custom malware.\n\nOpenCV \u2013 Taking photos from the web cam\nOpenAL \u2013 Recording Audio\nLibsndfile \u2013 C library used for reading and writing audio files\nLibCurl \u2013 For all network communications\nOpenCV and OpenAL\nBoth versions of Rover use OpenCV and OpenAL for some of the main functions.\n\nOpenCV is a library of functions written primarily for building real time computer vision applications, image processing and also machine learning. It has seen wide acceptance in security systems, medical image analysis, unmanned vehicles, visual surveillance, object tracking, Artificial Intelligence and many other applications.\n\nOpenAL is a cross-platform audio API for rendering multichannel three-dimensional positional audio (i.e., It is a means to generate audio in a three-dimensional space.) Earlier versions of OpenAL were opensource but later versions (since v1.1) have been proprietary.\n\nOnce executed, Rover creates following registry entry to execute itself when the computer reboots.\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\\"System Application\" = c:\\system\\WindowsSecurityService[2 or 3].exe\n\nThe malware then creates six threads, each with a different job:\n\n \tHeartbeat\n \tScreenshot\n \tStealing Files from HDD\n \tKeylogger\n \tSearch files on USB\n \tBackdoor\n\n\nFigure 7: Threads created by the malware\n1. Heartbeat:\nThis sends heartbeat signal on HTTP to the C2 server at 46.166.165.254 every five seconds and checks whether the C2 server is running.\n2. ScreenShot:\nThis saves screenshots as c:\\system\\screenshot.bmp and sends it to the C2 server at 46.166.165.254 every 60 minutes.\n\n\nFigure 8: Screenshots sent to C2 server at 46.166.165.254\n3. Finding specific file types on Removable Drive:\nThis thread searches for for files with the following extensions on removable drives and copies them to \u2018c:\\system\u2019 every 5 seconds.\n\n \tpdf\n \tdoc\n \tdocx\n \tppt\n \tpptx\n \txls\n \txlsx\n\n4. Keylogger:\nThis logs key strokes at \u2018c:\\system\\log.txt\u2019 and sends captured data to the C2 every 10 seconds\n5. Stealing specific file types from Hard Drive:\nThis thread searches for for files with the following extensions on fixed drives and sends them to C2 every 60 minutes.\n\n \tpdf\n \tdoc\n \tdocx\n \tppt\n \tpptx\n \txls\n \txlsx\n\n\nFigure 9: Document file being sent to C2\n6. Backdoor:\nThis thread obtains backdoor commands from C2 every 10 seconds and executes them. Backdoor commands are listed below:\n\n\n\nCommand\nDescription\n\n\nCAMERA\nTake photos using system webcam and store them as c:\\system\\camera.jpg before sending to the C2.\n\n\nAUDIO\nRecord audio from default audio input as c:\\system\\audio.ogg and sending it to the C2.\n\n\nSCREEN\nTake a screenshot and save it as c:\\system\\screenshot.bmp then send it to the C2.\n\n\nKILL\nRemove persistence registry entry and terminate itself.\n\n\n\nThough 'Rover' is unsophisticated and lacks many modern features common to advanced malware, detection rate of the 'Rover' is extremely low. At the time of this writing, two out of three samples on VirusTotal were not detected by any Antivirus product\n\n\nFigure 10: No detection by any AV product on Virustotal\n\nFigure 11: Low detection rate\n\nSummary\nOpenCV has been extensively used by organizations, government bodies, and research groups for real time capture, image manipulation, object detection and many other uses in new forms of Human-Computer interaction, security systems, driver-less cars among many others. OpenCV was also used by the Mars Rovers to send captured data back to Earth.\n\nIt is interesting to see the very code used in such significant projects also being used to track and spy on individuals being targeted and which can remain undetected by traditional security systems. Though 'Rover' is an unsophisticated malware lacking modern malware features, it seems to be successful in bypassing traditional security systems and fulfilling the objectives of the threat actor behind the campaign in exfiltrating information from the targeted victim. It is important to understand the techniques and tools being used by such threat actors to better defend and protect organizations from such threats.\n\nPalo Alto Networks AutoFocus users can identify this threat using the Rover tag.\nIOCs:\nC2:\n46.166.165.254\n\nDownloader hosting links:\nnewsumbrella[.]net\/ne3s\/lat3st\/w0rld\/systemupdateAPI[.]exe\nnewsumbrella[.]net\/ne3s\/file[.]exe\nnewsumbrella[.]net\/bla3k\/extra7\/systemupdateAPI[.]exe\u00a0\n\n\n\nFilename \nFile Type\nSHA 256\n\n\nAppreciation_letter.doc\nRTF\n6c9862a65741b56b849928300\naff310d60b815ee5f5f9f133469\ne3b035e7e936\n\n\nQuestionnaire.doc\nRTF\n5f656cf07a1d5e7c439aad4023\n5dc78e47bac719c62e03728cc\n40267383880bd\n\n\nTerrorism.doc;India &amp;amp\nRTF\n6096ff941af95638944f2fcdf4a5\n046aa028b803b010b1a2d000\n028b1a4967bc\n\n\nAppreciation_\nletter.doc\nRTF\n7bf3a425be41ad9cc713e4821\n6e061c788f36e2727de5d0b6b\n6ac4f435fe1c06\n\n\n\nRTF\n06b12649dba7f61cb581f97797\nbdfba3a7f057a36b448d4c91a3\na7d89fff8d54\n\n\nWindowsSecurity\nService3.exe\nPE\n61a2935fcb0a385f9e67855ef6f\n95bda5f09fdb7c1435f215ce18\nb7b61993daa\n\n\nfile.exe\nPE\na5e5571cda838e97a6beb1a65\nacdfbaaf80027f60417aadb0d3\n4292f19c0f3b3\n\n\nWindowsSecurity\nService2.exe\nPE\n7757517ae6b4d513a57826f9ab\n65bd070d99d25ac526cfae3e99\n55c3c7cd457a\n\n\nWindowsSecurity\nService3.exe\nPE\n3dc709a3bcaa82220d6a76ea47\n374bd864c37817c7041c7e9f4e\ne8ba42847f34\n\n\n\nReferences\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Afghanistan%E2%80%93India_relations\nhttp:\/\/docs.opencv.org\/3.1.0\/#gsc.tab=0\nhttp:\/\/docs.opencv.org\/2.4\/modules\/highgui\/doc\/highgui.html\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/OpenAL\nhttp:\/\/www.cs.uml.edu\/~holly\/teaching\/91450\/spring2013\/bschroeder_vision_robotics1.pdf\nhttps:\/\/ti.arc.nasa.gov\/m\/pub-archive\/422h\/0422%20(Pedersen).pdf","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","@id":"#panworg"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"","width":"","height":""},"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Vicky Ray"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Kaoru Hayashi"}]}</script><link rel='stylesheet' id='crayon-css'  href='https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/plugins/crayon-syntax-highlighter/css/min/crayon.min.css?ver=_2.7.2_beta' type='text/css' media='all' />

                    <p>On December 24, 2015, Unit 42 identified a targeted attack, delivered via email, on a high profile Indian diplomat, an Ambassador to Afghanistan. The body and content of the email suggest that it was crafted and spoofed to look like it was sent by the current Defence Minister of India, Mr. Manohar Parrikar, commending the Ambassador on his contributions and success.</p>
<p>India has been a key nation in building and funding Afghanistan’s infrastructure and economic development, which includes setting up iron ore mines, steel plants, power plants and transportation systems, helping reconstruct the Salma Dam and constructing a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan%E2%80%93India_relations" target="_blank">Parliament Complex</a> for the Afghan Government.</p>
<p>Given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan%E2%80%93India_relations" target="_blank">India’s significant contributions</a> to the development of Afghanistan, it is likely that there may be groups or nations who would be interested in tracking and spying on key individuals who officially represent India in Afghanistan.<span id="more-12492"></span></p>
<h3>Overview of Rover infection</h3>
<p>Figure 1 gives an overview of the exploitation, infection and C2 communications of the &#8216;Rover&#8217; Trojan campaign targeting a victim running Windows XP.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Indian-Ambassador-1.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12493" src="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Indian-Ambassador-1-500x343.png" alt="Indian Ambassador 1" width="500" height="343" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1: Overview of the infection flow and C2 communications</p>
<p>Rover Trojan Infection Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>RTF file exploits CVE-2010-3333 and downloads an executable from newsumbrella[.]net.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>The executable file downloaded from <span style="line-height: 1.5;">newsumbrella[.]net </span>is executed on the victim machine.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>The executable &#8216;<em>file.exe</em>&#8216; is a downloader which is used to call out to a server with the IP &#8216;<em>46.166.165.254</em>&#8216; and download the main Rover malware along with plugins used by the Rover malware.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Rover malware and plugins are downloaded and installed on the victim machine.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Data exfiltrated from the victim machine.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Targeting and Infection</h3>
<p>Figure 2 shows an email which was sent to the Ambassador of India, appearing to commend the contributions the Ambassador has made in the development and success of projects on national interest, and attaching a letter of appreciation with a file name, “Appreciation_letter.doc”.</p>
<p>The attachment is an RTF file which exploits a specific vulnerability in Microsoft Word, CVE-2010-3333.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Indian-Ambassador-2.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12494" src="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Indian-Ambassador-2-500x577.png" alt="Indian Ambassador 2" width="500" height="577" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Figure 2: Spear phishing email sent to the Ambassador of Afghanistan</p>
<p>If the recipient of the e-mail opened the attachment in a vulnerable version of Word, the exploit code would download and execute a file from the domain <em>newsumbrella[.]net</em> as shown in Figure 3 below.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Indian-Ambassador-3.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12495" src="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Indian-Ambassador-3-500x127.png" alt="Indian Ambassador 3" width="500" height="127" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 3: Hexdump showing the domain and the executable downloaded</p>
<h3>Malware Analysis</h3>
<p>During the time of analysis the executable file <em>systemupdateAPI.exe</em> was no longer being hosted on the newsumbrealla[.]net domain. However, we have noticed the same domain hosting another executable in the past within the same parent directory and having a similar naming for the folders as shown below</p>
<p><em>newsumbrella[.]net/ne3s/lat3st/w0rld/systemupdateAPI[.]exe</em></p>
<p><em>newsumbrella[.]net/ne3s/file[.]exe – hosted earlier</em></p>
<p>We believe that the executables hosted under the parent directory ‘ne3s’ are variants of the same downloader Trojan, which was used to download the Rover Trojan. The file, <em>file.exe,</em> contains the following debug information that indicates the file was originally named <em>systemupdateAPI.exe</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Indian-Ambassador-42.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12505" src="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Indian-Ambassador-42-500x97.png" alt="Indian Ambassador 4" width="500" height="97" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 4: Debug information of downloader program</p>
<p>By analyzing file.exe, we can see that it is a downloader, which creates ‘<em>c:\system</em>’ directory and depending on the OS version used, downloads the main Rover payload along with multiple DLL modules from 46.166.165.254.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Indian-Ambassador-5.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12497" src="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Indian-Ambassador-5-500x669.png" alt="Indian Ambassador 5" width="500" height="669" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 5: Code snippet showing the OS version check and the subsequent download from 46.166.165.254</p>
<p>If the infected system is running an OS version prior to Windows Vista, it would download the following files from 46.166.165.254:</p>
<ul>
<li>WindowsSecurityService2.exe (&#8216;Rover&#8217; main module)</li>
<li>Openal32.dll</li>
<li>Cxcore210.dll (OpenCV)</li>
<li>Highgui210.dll (OpenCV)</li>
<li>libsndfile-1.dll</li>
</ul>
<p>If the OS version is Windows Vista or later, it would download the following files from 46.166.165.254 :</p>
<ul>
<li>WindowsSecurityService3.exe (&#8216;Rover&#8217; main module)</li>
<li>OpenAL32.dll</li>
<li>opencv_world300.dll</li>
<li>msvcp100.dll</li>
<li>msvcp110.dll</li>
<li>msvcp120.dll</li>
<li>msvcr100.dll</li>
<li>msvcr110.dll</li>
<li>msvcr120.dll</li>
</ul>
<p>After retrieving these files, the downloader Trojan executes the main module. Even though the main modules use different library versions, the functionality of the backdoors are identical.</p>
<p>By analyzing the files downloaded to the victim machine, we can see that the executable <em>WindowsSecurityService2.exe</em> imports the four DLL files that were downloaded to the same directory. The four DDLs are <em>cxcore210.dll, highgui210.dll, OpenAL32.dll</em> and <em>libsndfile-1.dll</em> as shown in Figure 6</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Indian-Ambassador-6.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12508" src="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Indian-Ambassador-6-500x280.png" alt="Indian Ambassador 6" width="500" height="280" /></a></em></p>

<p>The author of &#8216;Rover&#8217; used the following open source projects to implement the main functionalities of this custom malware.</p>
<p>OpenCV – Taking photos from the web cam<br />
OpenAL – Recording Audio<br />
Libsndfile – C library used for reading and writing audio files<br />
LibCurl – For all network communications</p>
<h3><strong>OpenCV and OpenAL</strong></h3>
<p>Both versions of Rover use <a href="http://opencv.org/" target="_blank">OpenCV</a> and <a href="https://www.openal.org" target="_blank">OpenAL</a> for some of the main functions.</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.opencv.org/master/d1/dfb/intro.html#gsc.tab=0" target="_blank">OpenCV</a> is a library of functions written primarily for building real time <a href="http://www.cs.uml.edu/~holly/teaching/91450/spring2013/bschroeder_vision_robotics1.pdf" target="_blank">computer vision</a> applications, image processing and also machine learning. It has seen wide acceptance in security systems, medical image analysis, unmanned vehicles, visual surveillance, object tracking, Artificial Intelligence and many other applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAL" target="_blank">OpenAL</a> is a cross-platform audio API for rendering multichannel three-dimensional positional audio (i.e., It is a means to generate audio in a three-dimensional space.) Earlier versions of OpenAL were opensource but later versions (since v1.1) have been proprietary.</p>
<p>Once executed, Rover creates following registry entry to execute itself when the computer reboots.</p>
<p><em>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\&#8221;System Application&#8221; = c:\system\WindowsSecurityService[2 or 3].exe</em></p>
<p>The malware then creates six threads, each with a different job:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heartbeat</li>
<li>Screenshot</li>
<li>Stealing Files from HDD</li>
<li>Keylogger</li>
<li>Search files on USB</li>
<li>Backdoor</li>
</ul>

<p>Though &#8216;Rover&#8217; is unsophisticated and lacks many modern features common to advanced malware, detection rate of the &#8216;Rover&#8217; is extremely low. At the time of this writing, two out of three samples on VirusTotal were not detected by any Antivirus product</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>OpenCV has been extensively used by organizations, government bodies, and research groups for real time capture, image manipulation, object detection and many other uses in new forms of Human-Computer interaction, security systems, driver-less cars among many others. OpenCV was also used by the <a href="https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/422h/0422%20(Pedersen).pdf" target="_blank">Mars Rovers</a> to send captured data back to Earth.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see the very code used in such significant projects also being used to track and spy on individuals being targeted and which can remain undetected by traditional security systems. Though &#8216;Rover&#8217; is an unsophisticated malware lacking modern malware features, it seems to be successful in bypassing traditional security systems and fulfilling the objectives of the threat actor behind the campaign in exfiltrating information from the targeted victim. It is important to understand the techniques and tools being used by such threat actors to better defend and protect organizations from such threats.</p>
<p>Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus users can identify this threat using the <a href="https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Rover" target="_blank">Rover tag</a>.</p>
