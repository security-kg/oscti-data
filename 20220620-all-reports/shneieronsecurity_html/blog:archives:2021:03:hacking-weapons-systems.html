		<p>Lukasz Olejnik has a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dire-possibility-cyberattacks-weapons-systems/">good essay</a> on hacking weapons systems.</p>
<p>Basically, there is no reason to believe that software in weapons systems is any more vulnerability free than any other software. So now the question is whether the software can be accessed over the Internet. Increasingly, it is. This is likely to become a bigger problem in the near future. We need to think about future wars where the tech simply doesn&#8217;t work.</p>

				<p>@ Bruce,</p>
<blockquote><p>Basically, there is no reason to believe that software in weapons systems is any more vulnerability free than any other software.</p></blockquote>
<p>Err it depends on what you are comparing. If &#8220;like for like&#8221; then yes you would expect them to be similar. Thus an Avionics system in both Civil and Military aircraft I would not expect to be that much disimilar.</p>
<p>But comparing a military aircraft avionics or misile guidence system with a one dollar download in the Apple Store or other &#8220;walled garden&#8221; I would expect the app to be very much diffetent.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written both Safety Critical and Fast Moving Consumer Goods software in my time both at the assembler level. Whilst I used very similar design methodology and in design testing, I know that conformance paperwork and post development pre production testing were way way more indepth on the Safety Critical stuff.</p>
<p>In part the reason they were treated the same in development was down to me, I&#8217;ve been in code shops where the development was abouts as sloppy as you could get, as the emphasis was &#8220;slapping the features in&#8221; rather than taking a little more time up front to save a lot of time down stream a ways.</p>
<p>@ ALL,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found that if you get the foundations and structure right then the rest kind of drops comfortably in place. However trying to rush the foundations and structure almost always leads to poor quality rework and worse&#8230;</p>
<p>Engineers generally know how to do things well, if they have the time to do so. Managment on the other hand have a different view point, that unfortunately they are alowed to get away with way more often than they should.</p>
<p>As was once noted and has been attributed to John Glen,</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt exactly how you would feel if you were getting ready to launch and knew you were sitting on top of 2 million parts&#8230; all built by the lowest bidder on a government contract.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not what you want those under flag to be worrying about, when facing off with another nations millitary.</p>
<p>As noted by George Patton,</p>
<p>&#8220;No dumb bastard ever won a war by going out and dying for his country. He won it by making some other dumb bastard die for his country.&#8221;</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t want to be turning our own into &#8220;dumb bastards&#8221; just because those in charge trot out brain dead mantra&#8217;s about doing more with less, thus giving others more profit than there should be because we are doing it on the cheap by not doing things either safely or properly.</p>

&#8220;I’ve found that if you get the foundations and structure right then the rest kind of drops comfortably in place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Long time ago, I saw that a central course in (classic) AI was &#8220;Algorithms and data structures&#8221;. I was told that this was programming, plain and simple. You design the data structures and pick the algorithms and the rest is filling in the slots.</p>
<p>With communication, things get more interesting again 🙂</p>

				<p>@ Winter,</p>
<blockquote><p>With communication, things get more interesting again</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve found the three big issues people,have with communications is,</p>
<p>1, Serialization issues.<br />
2, End to End state issues.<br />
3, Time delay issues.</p>
<p>Whilst there are standards and tools (ASN.1) that give rise to libraries of serialisation code so that any data has the same meaning when received that it had when it was transmitted. Many programers can not easily get over the other issues.</p>
<p>In part because most programers never ever see the issues that arise in their ordinary work.</p>
<p>For the average programmer data travels left to rigth across the page and not back again. As for errors and exceptions they are often ignored, or &#8220;blue screen of deathed&#8221;, which you can not do with most comms.</p>
<p>But when they do try to handle errors and exceptions especially when long delayed from the originating issue their world view &#8220;Does not compute&#8221;. In part this is because writers of libraries have tried to hide lifes nastier little realities from them.</p>
<p>Try explaining why you might switch from Ack/Nack to sliding windows or Forward Error Correction (FEC) or some combination and you had better have had a good meal and a very hot mug of coffee because it might be some time before you get either again 😉</p>
<p>Then there are &#8220;error codes&#8221; even something as simple as a Hamming code can cause strained looks and trust me it generally goes down hill from there on in.</p>
<p>But even writing a very simple terminal program for close local access causes real issues as anyone who has tried writing one under a Posix compliant OS can tell you. Explaining the issues of blocking and the use of the select(2) and poll(2) system calls can be fun. But at the end of the 90&#8217;s over shadowed by other events C10k became an issue and there was no way on God&#8217;s little Green Apple, that select and poll would ever keep up. So&#8230; BSD came up with kqueue in 2000 and Linux later came up with epoll that was messy messy messy, thus a chunk of it got depreciated quite quickly.</p>

				<p>@ Bruce said &#8220;We need to think about future wars where the tech simply doesn’t work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure, redundancy (i.e. more than one technology should be available to complete the same task)always important, but<br />
recently I start more often thinking about recent situation in the world, and unfortunately, it reminds me being on the brink on the WWI when simple spark could bring us to the super disaster.</p>
<p>Looks like now we are like two guys standing up to the waist in gasoline and arguing who has more matches, as if there is chance to survive.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll suggest moving to de-escalation in relationship within triangle US-Russia-China rather than confrontation and testing each other red lines. But who am I with my bleeping logical opinion?</p>

				<p>I ‘attended’ &#8211; i.e. watched via browser &#8211; a recent (Distro A) NDIA conference and one of the striking themes was their focus on hardening their software.  The US military are well aware if this threat it seems.</p>

<p>Yes.  But I am old school greybeard, so what do I know?</p>
<p>It may be that I do not know what I know.</p>
<p>But, I surprise myself and &#8216;stuff&#8217; is recalled.</p>

				<p>I recall back over 40 years ago in a computer science lecture from Carver Mead at CalTech. He mentioned that one of the new fighter jets, the F-15 I think, was not controlled by mechanical linkages. A microprocessor sent the commands from the stick movement to the controls of the aircraft. He paused and then said &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want to be in that airplane.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wonder what he would think now.</p>

				<p>Friend of mine works for a navy that uses US-made automated 5-inch gun turrets.  He did a security assessment of them and found that their security was based entirely on the assumption that during combat the other side&#8217;s ships were too far away to tell the turret to activate, turn, and put a round into the deck of the ship it was on.  He apparently explained the process in some detail to the bigwigs, and let them figure out that sometimes&#8230; actually a lot of the time, ships are in port, or within easy range of someone in a passing saiboat, or a Zodiac dinghy.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards the Navy disabled most of the &#8220;intelligence&#8221; of the turret.</p>

<blockquote><p>He mentioned that one of the new fighter jets, the F-15 I think, was not controlled by mechanical linkages. A microprocessor sent the commands from the stick movement to the controls of the aircraft. He paused and then said “I wouldn’t want to be in that airplane.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He might have known about or heard the story about how the test pilot wrote of the first flight prototype by crashing it without the wheels ever leaving the ground&#8230;</p>
<p>The story is he got into the aircraft after doing all the standard checks, then punched the button to retract the under carrage&#8230; And the computer complied with the request.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m told you can not do that with mechanical linkages, because whilst their is weight on the wheels there is a mechanical interlock to stop them under carraige colapsing due to mechanical fault.</p>
