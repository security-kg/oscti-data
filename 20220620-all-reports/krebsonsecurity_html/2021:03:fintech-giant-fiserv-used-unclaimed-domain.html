				<p>If you sell Web-based software for a living and ship code that references an unregistered domain name, you are asking for trouble. But when the same mistake is made by a Fortune 500 company, the results can range from costly to disastrous. Here&#8217;s the story of one such goof committed by <strong>Fiserv </strong>[<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/fisv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASDAQ:FISV</a>], a $15 billion firm that provides online banking software and other technology solutions to thousands of financial institutions.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-44816" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fiserve.png" alt="" width="597" height="302" /></p>
<p>In November 2020, KrebsOnSecurity heard from security researcher <strong>Abraham Vegh</strong>, who noticed something odd while inspecting an email from his financial institution.</p>
<p>Vegh could see the message from his bank referenced a curious domain: <strong>defaultinstitution.com</strong>. A quick search of WHOIS registration records showed the domain was unregistered. Wondering whether he might receive email communications to that address if he registered the domain, Vegh snapped it up for a few dollars, set up a catch-all email account for it, and waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;It appears that the domain is provided as a default, and customer bank IT departments are either assuming they don’t need to change it, or are not aware that they could/should,&#8221; Vegh said, noting that a malicious person who stumbled on his discovery earlier could have had a powerful, trusted domain from which to launch email phishing attacks.</p>
<p>At first, only a few wayward emails arrived. Ironically enough, one was from a &#8220;quality assurance&#8221; manager at Fiserv. The automatic reply message stated that the employee was out of the office &#8220;on R&amp;R&#8221; and would be back to work on Dec. 14.</p>
<p>Many other emails poured in, including numerous &#8220;bounced&#8221; messages delivered in reply to missives from <strong>Cashedge.com</strong>, a money transfer service that <a href="https://investors.fiserv.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fiserv-agrees-acquire-cashedge-advance-its-digital-payments-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fiserv acquired in 2011</a>.</p>
<p>Emails get bounced &#8212; or returned to the sender &#8212; when they are sent to an address that doesn&#8217;t exist or that is no longer active. The messages had been sent to an email address for a former client solutions director at Fiserv; the &#8220;reply-to:&#8221; address in those missives was &#8220;donotreply@defaultinstitution.com&#8221;.</p>
<p>The messages were informing customers of CashEdge&#8217;s main service <a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/solutions/payments/personal-payments-services/popmoney.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Popmoney</a> &#8212; which lets users send, request and receive money directly from bank accounts &#8212; that Popmoney was being replaced with <a href="https://www.zellepay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zelle</a>, a more modern bank-to-bank transfer service.</p>
<p>Each CashEdge missive included information about recurring transfers that were being canceled, such as the plan ID, send date, amount to be transferred, the name and last four digits of the account number the money was coming from, and the email address of the recipient account.</p>
<p>Incredibly, at the bottom of every message to CashEdge/Popmoney customers was a boilerplate text: &#8220;This email was sent to [recipient name here]. If you have received this email in error, please send an e-mail to customersupport@defaultinstitution.com.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-54537" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/popmoney.png" alt="" width="593" height="407" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/popmoney.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/popmoney-768x527.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-54409"></span>Other services that directed customers to reply to the researcher&#8217;s domain included Fiserv customer<strong> Netspend.com</strong>, a leading provider of prepaid debit cards that require no minimum balance or credit check. The messages from Netspend all were to confirm the email address tied to a new account, and concerned &#8220;me-to-me transfers&#8221; set up through its service.</p>
<p>Each message included a one-time code that recipients were prompted to enter at the company&#8217;s website. But from reading the many replies to these missives, it seems Netspend didn&#8217;t make it terribly obvious where users were supposed to input this code. Here&#8217;s one of the more profane examples of a customer response:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-54472 aligncenter" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/me-to-me-curse.png" alt="" width="596" height="464" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/me-to-me-curse.png 778w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/me-to-me-curse-768x598.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /></p>
<p>Many others emailed by Netspend expressed mystification as to why they were receiving such messages, stating they&#8217;d never signed up for the service. From the gist of those messages, the respondents were victims of identity fraud.</p>
<p>&#8220;My accounts were hacked and if any funding is gone your [sic] sued from me and federal trade commission,&#8221; one wrote. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t create the account. Please stop this account and let me know what&#8217;s going on,&#8221; replied another. &#8220;I never signed up for this service. Someone else is using my information,&#8221; wrote a third.</p>
<p>Those messages also concerned me-to-me transfers. Other emails came from Detroit-based <strong>TCF National Bank</strong>.</p>
<p>New York-based <strong>Union Bank</strong> also sent customer information to the researcher&#8217;s domain. Both of those messages were intended to confirm that the recipient had tied their accounts to those at another bank. And in both cases, the recipients replied that they had not authorized the linkage.</p>
<p>In response to questions from KrebsOnSecurity, Fiserv acknowledged that it had inadvertently included references to defaultinstitution.com as a placeholder in software solutions used by some partners.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have identified 5 clients for which auto-generated emails to their customers included the domain name “<a href="http://defaultinstitution.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://defaultinstitution.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614792728871000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFzE_uGsi3ixISJhRTTLmTo4UmWDw">defaultinstitution.com</a>” in the “reply-to” address,&#8221; Fiserv said in a written statement. &#8220;This placeholder URL was inadvertently left unchanged during implementation of these solutions. Upon being made aware of the situation we immediately conducted an analysis to locate and replace instances of the placeholder domain name. We have also notified the clients whose customers received these emails.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, the last email Vegh&#8217;s inbox received was on Feb. 26.</p>
<p>This is not the first time an oversight by Fiserv has jeopardized the security and privacy of its customers. In 2018, KrebsOnSecurity revealed how a programming weakness in a software platform sold to hundreds of banks <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/08/fiserv-flaw-exposed-customer-data-at-hundreds-of-banks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exposed personal and financial data of countless customers</a>. Fiserv was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/05/credit-union-sues-fintech-giant-fiserv-over-security-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later sued over the matter by a credit union customer</a>; that lawsuit is still proceeding.</p>
<p>Vegh said he found a similar domain goof while working as a contractor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia back in 2015. In that instance, he discovered <a href="https://whois.domaintools.com/airwatchmagreachability.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unregistered domain</a> invoked by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirWatch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AirWatch</a>, a mobile device management product since acquired by VMWare.</p>
<p>&#8220;After registering that domain I started getting traffic from all around the world from Fortune 500 company devices pinging the domain,&#8221; Vegh said.</p>
<p>Vegh said he plans to give Fiserv control over defaultinstitution.com, and hand over the messages intercepted by his inbox. He&#8217;s not asking for much in return.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had been promised a t-shirt and a case of beer for my efforts then, but alas, never received one,&#8221; he said of his interaction with AirWatch. &#8220;This time, I am hoping to actually receive a t-shirt!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Update, 12:44 p.m. ET:</strong> The lead paragraph has been updated to reflect Fiserv&#8217;s 2020 revenues, which were <a href="https://investors.fiserv.com/static-files/ea3fa101-4ca5-455c-ae75-1406653e2a60" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly $15 billion</a>.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Fiserv February&#8221; seems to be an annual event.  That is the month Fiserv caused a data breach at my credit union.  I am the CEO of the consumer owned credit union mentioned in this article that is taking Fiserv to court over it&#8217;s pervasive security failures.  My heart goes out to all the other impacted consumers and institutions that have been victimized by yet another grossly irresponsible privacy blunder by Fiserv.  I encourage everyone to take their banking business to a financial institution like ours that dumped Fiserv and is willing to advocate for strong consumer privacy.  We look forward to getting justice for our members as part of ongoing litigation against Fiserv.</p>

      <p>I am an FIS employee, and therefore a little biased&#8230; While FIS is far from perfect, the organization is fanatical about info security (sometimes to the detriment of hitting delivery timeframes and usability). We were the first processor to receive formal MRA&#8217;s from the FFIEC about 10 years ago, which was more of a shot across the bow from the regulators to our industry as a whole (in their next audits Fiserv and Jack Henry also received MRA&#8217;s). But as a response, we made a commitment to our clients and shareholders (that continues today) to be the leader in info security, and we invest more in people, technology, and governance than anyone else in the industry. From the inside, I can tell you info security is now a central part of our culture. All employees are constantly required to take courses on information security, we have ongoing phishing tests (3 strikes and your fired), and our CISO and Chief Risk Office have robust oversight and ultimate authority over all of our lines of business. Again, I am not saying FIS is perfect, but I would strongly disagree with any assertion that we are not taking security seriously (just ask our partners at the DHS Cyber Crime Center).</p>

      <p>FIS is the only software system I have ever witnessed where timestamps went from 1 to 12, and back again with no way to distinguish AM from PM.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s more typical and convenient for computers to use 24h time, that&#8217;s fine most humans are not used to 24h time anyway. </p>
<p>What&#8217;s decidedly NOT fine is FIS not including the AM/PM period in these timestamps! I vividly remember the elaborate heurstic hacks needed to reconstruct that information as a consumer of that information, and very much hope that bug has been fixed by now. Slow progress, indeed.</p>

      <p>Fiserv threatened me also, when I reported the security problem with their online banking site.  They didn&#8217;t want me alerting their other customers or the press about their failure.  To me it seems that Fiserv prides itself on scaring security researchers and Fiserv clients into silence.  Evidently they think it&#8217;s wise to use the same &#8220;intimidate the victim&#8221; playbook used by sexual abusers.</p>
<p>Time&#8217;s up, Fiserv!  We won&#8217;t be silenced.  You&#8217;ve got big problems and it&#8217;s time to start addressing them.  If anyone has information related to security concerns with Fiserv, please feel free to e-mail me at <a href="mailto:jpeterson@bessfcu.com">jpeterson@bessfcu.com</a>.</p>

      <p>I used to work for Fiserv. What you have to understand is that Fiserv is just a holding company that buys up all the other companies to capitalize off of their success or shut down competition. I wound up there unfortunately by acquisition. You&#8217;d be flabbergasted how they force you to make changes that do not fit your existing infrastructure, run people off with all the domain knowledge and then assign you some Indians that have no idea of how the product works, much less work on it. They sell way more than they can deliver. It&#8217;s all about the stock price. I&#8217;m surprised there hasn&#8217;t been a colossal security failure due to their software yet.</p>

      <p>I wouldn&#8217;t say this is the right way since you hope that it is dumped. What is stopping IANA from changing this policy in the future or accidentally registering, even for a short period of time.</p>
<p>The correct way, IMHO, is it should be sent to a registered address owned by the company with the server designed to receive it to just bitbucket it. This allows the company to change those emails to be actually received if need be for review.</p>
<p>I believe this is an issue with companies and customers of those companies looking to push a product out as quick as possible, while reducing costs. Why isn&#8217;t FISERV not requiring a full setup that changes these defaults to what the customer really wants? Why don&#8217;t customers test, validate the products they install and use? Costs and the willing to not push back at those that actually pay them is a big part. It&#8217;s a community issue just as much as it is a lazy programming trying to make a buck.</p>

      <p>The best way for a programmer to do it is to build validation into the automated email. When you put in an email address it will send an email and you need to enter a code to save this email as valid. I had a vendor whose software setup required it before the product could go live. I was rather impressed.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve got stories about companies whose documentation used non-example domain names that they didn&#8217;t own.<br />
Others who used names they didn&#8217;t own in production and couldn&#8217;t figure why some things didn&#8217;t work. Others who used a non-owned domain name, then trouble came when an acqusition required that they enable DNS internally.</p>

      <p>Ask them.  One word of caution though, the financial institution doesn&#8217;t have to be using Fiserv for it&#8217;s core processing for consumer&#8217;s information to be at risk.  They have their hands in numerous other areas such as debit and credit card processing, online banking, bill pay, peer to peer transfers, etc.  That&#8217;s what makes these issues so terrifying.  It is the perfect demonstration of the saying &#8220;with great power comes great responsibility&#8221;.  Unfortunately they aren&#8217;t taking their responsibility to protect American consumers seriously enough.</p>

      <p>In years past I installed/configured bank software.  Many of the institutions utilized Fiserv for processing, and some had tried to use their free software, but quickly decided it wasn&#8217;t up to task.  Not sure if this is what was being used in this case or not.  Testing as well as configuration and training/support was our strength because we knew many banks didn&#8217;t have the expertise. The sad thing is many smaller banks had little/no training or IT person on staff and were not following security best practices.  A head teller or VP would also wear the IT hat and some reluctantly.  Even when they were trying it was difficult if they lacked training.  So issues with code and configuration are compounded when end users are not being properly trained.</p>

      <p>Yes, blame the teller for issues with a bank.  Blame MBA&#8217;s for not knowing programming languages. And blame the guard at the door, for lack of security training. But, who is be blamed, let&#8217;s see, the programmer who created the script,  they forgot to put a hold and a note where a input should be, how about a trainer, or book that didn&#8217;t emphasize the importance of changing that input to a proper one, but, yes, read the first sentence again.</p>

      <p>Thanks for that Jim!  The whole point of paying big bucks to these vendors is that we are supposed to be paying for expertise.  In fact, Fiserv even advertises their &#8220;Domain Expertise&#8221;.  Google Fiserv Domain and you will see what I mean.</p>
<p>Not only that, they maintain dictatorial control over everything.  In most cases this wouldn&#8217;t be something we would have access to change or even see on our side.</p>

      <p>You do realize that the term &#8220;Domain Knowledge&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean internet domains, it actually refers to knowledge of a specific, specialized discipline or field, in contrast to general knowledge, as in ACH or ATM or Bill Payment (and others) in Fiserv&#8217;s case.</p>

      <p>It&#8217;s not the programmer. When you develop applications that are used by multiple clients, you use a bunch of defaults that are configurable during implementation time. See my earlier comments about how they just throw new resources on a product that has no idea.. working with other teams at Fiserv was like working with an entirely different company, because they pretty much are!</p>

      <p>Anybody in the fin tech industry knows Fiserv is now Firs Data, the merger info was just Wall Street talk.  I cant comment on what security was like before, but they brought their whole security leadership over based on a LinkedIn search.  This was less than two years ago through the pandemic, so there is likely considerable restructuring happening.  One can only hope positive changes based on First Data&#8217;s history.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, Fiserv is more focused on hiring &#8220;enterprise agile coaches&#8221; and &#8220;scrum masters&#8221; in order to further their rinky-dink agile agenda, instead of investing that money into something useful such as security upgrades. There has been a ramp-up in the number of outages and it&#8217;s getting worse because First Data is laying off product experts in order to funnel a TON of money into NASCAR hood logo Clover advertisements. Nice one, Fiserv.</p>

      <p>Yikes &#8211; Fiserv is imploding at the seams at record rates. I reckon it&#8217;s time some federal regulators step in and pull the plug on the whole operation, to set an example that insecure low-quality rubbish software simply cannot be tolerated when it comes to sensitive customer data. Hopefully this is a wake-up call for Fiserv &#8220;leadership&#8221; and HR.</p>

      <p>Having worked at Fiserv before the FirstData merger, and still being there today, I can attest that security standards now are significantly more stringent than before. We do take security seriously, we do have mandates around TLS 1.2, and we do care about privacy. Troll away, y’all.</p>

      <p>You are right. Fiserv has taken a lots of steps towards to enhanced the security and but you can&#8217;t do anything if people don&#8217;t want to upgrades its like Iphone has launched lots of new versions and you still using Iphone4 so who will be responsible. if you are in some business clients also need to invest to upgrade them selfs.</p>

      <p>How about Fiserv&#8217;s core pride and joy, Premier, and the requirement for Internet Explorer (ActiveX)?  Using Compatibility Mode!  </p>
<p>We were once told that bank T1 VPNs to Fiserv would be going away for wireless.  Why?  Because it was more secure.  And they really believed that.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just the tip of the ice berg.  For their hosted environment, we&#8217;ve demonstrated/reported numerous ways that a single bank can access other bank&#8217;s customers&#8217; data.  So it only takes one tiny hosted bank with a tiny (or no) IT staff to be compromised then even the multi-billion $ FI&#8217;s go down, too.  Wonderful.  Oh yeah, and those vulnerabilities still exist, and reports have fallen on deaf ears.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re holding our data for ransom and making deconvesrion inaccessible.</p>

      <p>I had a bank that employed FIServe to handle online bill payments. Their &#8220;Cheesehead Wisconsin&#8221; support was so horribly bad that I closed my account and went looking for a bank that did not use them.</p>
<p>BTW &#8211; TCF is a Minnesota bank. Major jerks. Many years ago my gf missed a car payment. They took two fulltime employees and had them harass her every month multiple times a month to make sure she was going to pay, for almost two years, until the car was paid off.</p>

      <p>I work at a bank that uses Fiserv&#8217;s services. Not only is their software extremely buggy, but we have also run into a LOT of problems with their poorly configured firewalls. There are constant denial of service attacks, and then they will add rules to the firewall that end up blocking our own customers. My team is pretty fed up with Fiserv as a whole.</p>
