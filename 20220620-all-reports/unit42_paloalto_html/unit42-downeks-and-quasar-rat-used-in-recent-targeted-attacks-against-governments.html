DustySky is a campaign which others have attributed to the Gaza Cybergang group, a group that targets government interests in the region.\n\nThis report shares our researchers\u2019 analysis of the attack and Remote Access Tool (RAT). We also discovered during our research that the RAT Server used by this attacker is itself vulnerable to remote attack, a double-edged sword for these attackers.\nAttack\nThe initial infection vector in this attack is not clear, but it results in installing the \u201cDowneks\u201d downloader, which in turn infects the victim computer with the \u201cQuasar\u201d RAT.\n\nDowneks uses third party websites to determine the external IP of the victim machine, possibly to determine victim location with GeoIP. It also drops decoy documents in an attempt to camouflage the attack.\n\nQuasar is a .NET Framework-based open-source RAT. The attackers invested significant effort in attempting to hide the tool by changing the source code of the RAT and the RAT server, and by using an obfuscator and packer.\nDetection\nUnit 42 researchers observed the Quasar RAT being prevented from executing on a Traps-protected client in September 2016. We observed these Quasar samples:\nFile Name:\u00a0 f-secure.exe\nSHA256: 99a7cb43fb2898810956b6137d803c8f97651e23f9f13e91887f188749bd5e8f\nNote: connects to hnoor.newphoneapp[.]com\nFile Name:\u00a0 HD_Audio.exe\nSHA256: 0c4aa50c95c990d5c5c55345626155b87625986881a2c066ce032af6871c426a\nNote: connects to manual.newphoneapp[.]com\nFile Name: HD_Audio.exe\nSHA256: 86bd78b4c8c94c046d927fb29ae0b944bf2a8513a378b51b3977b77e59a52806\nNote:\u00a0 crashes upon execution\nFile Name: sim.exe\nSHA256: 723108103ccb4c166ad9cdff350de6a898489f1dac7eeab23c52cd48b9256a42\nNote: connects to hnoor.newphoneapp[.]com\nFurther research found other Quasar examples, an attack earlier in the month 2016 on the same target:\nSHA256: 1ac624aaf6bbc2e3b966182888411f92797bd30b6fcce9f8a97648e64f13506f\nWe found the same Quasar code in an additional attack on the same day, but upon a different target. A second Quasar sample was also observed attacking this new victim:\nSHA256: 99a7cb43fb2898810956b6137d803c8f97651e23f9f13e91887f188749bd5e8f\nWe do not have detailed visibility into the specific host attacked, and have not been able to reproduce the second stage of the attack in our lab. However, based upon the timeframe of subsequent telemetry we observe, we understand the attack chain as follows:\n\n \tThe initial dropper (which varies across attacks) is delivered to the victim via email or web:\n\nFile Name: Joint Ministerial Council between the GCC and the EU Council.exe\"\nSHA256: 0d235478ae9cc87b7b907181ccd151b618d74955716ba2dbc40a74dc1cdfc4aa\n\n\n \tThe initial dropper, upon execution, extracts an embedded Downeks instance:\n\nFile Name: ati.exe\nSHA256: f19bc664558177b7269f52edcec74ecdb38ed2ab9e706b68d9cbb3a53c243dec\n\n\n \tDowneks makes a POST request to dw.downloadtesting[.]com, resulting in the installation of the Quasar RAT on the victim machine.\n \tAdditional Downeks downloaders connecting to the previously-observed server dw.downloadtesting[.]com were also found in this attack:\n\nSHA256: 15abd32342e87455b73f1e2ecf9ab10331600eb4eae54e1dfc25ba2f9d8c2e8a\nSHA256: 9a8d73cb7069832b9523c55224ae4153ea529ecc50392fef59da5b5d1db1c740\nFurther research identified dozens of Dowenks and Quasar samples related to these attackers. All included decoy documents written in Arabic (all related to Middle Eastern politics) or Hebrew. Most of them use the same mutex structure, share the same fake icon and unique metadata details, file writes, registry operations, and fake common program metadata, as seen in DustySky samples.\n\nThe Downeks downloader and Quasar C2 infrastructures are each self-contained and independent of each other. However, we did find a single shared IP address demonstrably connecting the Downeks downloader and Quasar C2 infrastructure s. The below chart (Figure 1) shows Quasar infrastructure (top), Downeks (bottom), and the shared IP link.\n\n\n\nFigure 1- Quasar and Downeks\n\nCharting the samples and infrastructure clearly shows the separate Downeks campaigns, and infrastructure links (Figure 2):\n\n\n\nFigure 2- Infrastructure Patterns and Connections\n\nIn Figure 2, top-right (green) has the Quasar infrastructure (Figure 3), with a link to the Downeks infrastructure. Left (yellow) is DustySky infrastructure (Figure 4) and the links to this Downeks campaign. As well as similarities in the code, decoys and targets, we also identified C2 infrastructure links between DustySky and this campaign. The remainder is sub-campaigns of Downeks samples, their infrastructure, their links \u2013 and a favored ISP (center) (Figure 5).\n\n\n\nThe timing of the attacks is commensurate with the Middle-Eastern working week (Figure 6):\n\n\n\nFigure 6- Attacks by day-of-the-week\n\nThe sample build days-of-the-week follow an almost identical pattern (Figure 7):\n\n\n\nFigure 7- Builds by day-of-the-week\n\nWe saw five samples built on the same date in December 2015, and six on the same date in January, further solidifying the link between each sample.\nQuasar\nWe analyzed a Quasar sample we found that was communicating with an active C2 server at the time of analysis:\nSHA256: 4393ff391396cdfd229517dd98aa7faecad04da479fe8ca322f035ceee363273\nQuasar is a publicly-available commodity RAT, an evolution of his earlier xRAT, by German developer \u201cMaxXor\u201d. This sample is a modified version of Quasar, most likely forked from open source version 1.2.0.0 on GitHub. The client was likely built using the Quasar server client builder. We observed the following customizations:\n\nC2 server:\napp.progsupdate[.]com, which resolved to 185.141.25[.]68), over port 4664.\nQuasar mutex name:\nVMFvdCsC7RFqerZinfV0sxJFo\nKeylogger log location:\nUsers\\hJTQwqwwSCkZU\\AppData\\Roaming\\GoogleDesktop\\&lt;date&gt;\nThe malware uses fake version information to appear as a Microsoft update program, as well as Google Desktop once unpacked.\n\n\nPacker\nThis sample is packed by \u201cNetz\u201d, a simple .NET Framework packer which stores the original executable compressed (zlib) as a resource. At runtime, the packer decompresses the resource and uses Reflection to load the assembly, find its Entry point, and Invoke it. Extracting the payload is straight forward \u2013 we simply dump the resource and decompress it. After decompilation, the packer looks like this:\npublic static int Main(string[] args) { \ntry { \nNetzStarter.InitXR(); \nAppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve += new ResolveEventHandler(NetzStarter.NetzResolveEventHandler); \nreturn NetzStarter.StartApp(args);\nFind the resource and call InvokeApp:\n\npublic static int StartApp(string[] args) { \nbyte[] resource = NetzStarter.GetResource(\"A6C24BF5-3690-4982-887E-\n11E1B159B249\"); \nreturn NetzStarter.InvokeApp(NetzStarter.GetAssembly(resource), args); \n\nGet the assembly object by decompressing the resource and loading it with Reflection:\n\nprivate static Assembly GetAssembly(byte[] data) { \nMemoryStream memoryStream = (MemoryStream) null; \nmemoryStream = NetzStarter.UnZip(data); \nmemoryStream.Seek(0L, SeekOrigin.Begin); \nreturn Assembly.Load(memoryStream.ToArray()); \n}\u00a0\n\nAnd finally, find the entry point and invoke it:\n\nprivate static int InvokeApp(Assembly assembly, string[] args) { \nMethodInfo entryPoint = assembly.EntryPoint; \nParameterInfo[] parameters1 = entryPoint.GetParameters(); \nobject[] parameters2 = (object[]) null; \nif (parameters1 != null &amp;&amp; parameters1.Length &gt; 0)\nparameters2 = new object[1]{ (object) args }; \nobject obj = entryPoint.Invoke((object) null, parameters2); \n\nExtracting produces:\nSHA256: c931de65d9655a772d23e4227a627a1140d8d3c4912ca71c324421b13efa1a02\n\nThis layer uses obfuscation in an attempt to avoid detection\/analysis.\nObfuscation\nWe discovered that the sample was obfuscated using .NET reactor. It is possible to decompile the deobfuscated sample and retrieve most of the original source code but not enough to compile it easily.\n\nAfter deobfuscation we extracted:\nSHA256: d773b12894d4a0ffb0df328e7e1aa4a7112455e88945a10471650e503eecdb3d\n\nQuasar Code\nAfter decompiling the sample, we were able to document the modifications from the open-source Quasar.\n\nSettings\nThe configuration of Quasar is stored in the Settings object, which is encrypted with a password which is itself stored unencrypted.\n\npublic static class Settings { \npublic static string VERSION; \npublic static string HOSTS; \npublic static int RECONNECTDELAY; \npublic static string PASSWORD;          \/\/ password for encryption of communication\npublic static Environment.SpecialFolder SPECIALFOLDER; \npublic static string DIR; \npublic static string SUBFOLDER; \npublic static string INSTALLNAME; \npublic static bool INSTALL; \npublic static bool STARTUP; \npublic static string MUTEX; \npublic static string STARTUPKEY; \npublic static bool HIDEFILE; \npublic static bool ENABLELOGGER; \npublic static string ENCRYPTIONKEY;     \/\/ Encryption password of the settings\npublic static string TAG; \npublic static string LOGDIRECTORYNAME; \npublic static bool HIDELOGDIRECTORY; \npublic static bool ISCHECKIP; \npublic static int INSTARTUPFOLDER;\n\nModifications:\n\n \tThe ISCHECKIP and INSTARTUPFOLDER are not found in open source Quasar samples.\n\nCryptography\nThe sample we analyzed is using RijndaelManaged with ECB mode and PKCS7 padding. The key is the SHA256 hash of the hard-coded password. The password of the sample we analyzed is:\n\u201c6y7u^Y&amp;U6y7u^Y&amp;U6y7u^Y&amp;U\u201d\nAlthough at first glance this appears somewhat complex, it is in fact a rather simple, repeated keyboard sequence. We observe similar keyboard patterns in other samples: \u201c567%^&amp;\u201d, \u201czxc!@#ASD\u201d.\npublic static void SetDefaultKey(string key) {\nbyte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(key); \nAES._defaultKey = SHA256.Create().ComputeHash(bytes);\n\u00a0\nprivate static void EncDec(Stream src, Stream ds, bool encDec, byte[] key) { \nRijndaelManaged rijndaelManaged = new RijndaelManaged(); \nrijndaelManaged.Key = key; \nrijndaelManaged.Mode = CipherMode.ECB; \nrijndaelManaged.Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7; \nrijndaelManaged.BlockSize = AES.BlockSize * 8; \nif (encDec) { \nICryptoTransform encryptor = rijndaelManaged.CreateEncryptor();\nCryptoStream cryptoStream = new CryptoStream(ds, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write);\nlong position = src.Position; \nAES.CopyTo(src, (Stream) cryptoStream, 8192); \ncryptoStream.FlushFinalBlock(); \n} else { \nICryptoTransform decryptor = rijndaelManaged.CreateDecryptor();\nAES.CopyTo(new CryptoStream(src, decryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Read), ds, 8192); \n} \n}\n\nModifications:\n\n \tUses SHA256 instead of MD5 to create the key.\n \tUses RijndaelManaged instead of AES for encryption. (with ECB mode, which is considered weak).\n\nSerialization\nQuasar contains the NetSerializer library that handles serialization of high level IPacket objects that the client and server use to communicate. The serialization assigns unique IDs for serializable objects types. The open source and several other samples we found give a dynamically-assigned 1 byte ID at compile time. The sample we analyzed changed that behavior and hard-coded DWORD for each object type. This is a better implementation, as it allows servers and clients from different versions to communicate with each other to some extent.\n\nprivate static void initTypeMap() { \nExts.dict_0.Add(typeof (object), -737641570);\n Exts.dict_0.Add(typeof (GetPasswordsResponse), -692037318);\n Exts.dict_0.Add(typeof (List&lt;string&gt;), 1046249082);\n Exts.dict_0.Add(typeof (int), -118636331);\n Exts.dict_0.Add(typeof (string[]), -2103720204);\n Exts.dict_0.Add(typeof (string), 1236129805);\n\nVersion\nThe sample we analyzed is most likely forked from open source quasar 1.2.0.0. We find multiple file\/object names hinting at the version, but must compelling:\n\n \tQuasar version 1.1.0.0 names the encryption module name space \"Encryption\", while subsequent Quasar versions use \"Cryptography\" \u2013 which we observe in this sample.\n \tQuasar version 1.3.0.0 changed the encryption key generation, and stopped saving the password in the sample. There are more indications as well, such as names of objects, files etc.\n\nOther samples we analyzed had different combinations of modification to cryptography and serialization.\nThe C2 server\nOur decompilation of the serialization library was not complete enough to allow simple recompilation. Instead, we downloaded and compiled the 1.2.0.0 server of the open-source Quasar RAT, having determined that this seemed likely the most similar version. The out-of-the-box server could not communicate with the client sample owing to the previously documented modifications that we had observed. We incorporated those changes into our build, discovering that this worked for most sample versions with almost no further modification.\n\nBoth the client and the server use the same code to serialize and encrypt the communications. Instead of compiling a different server for each client, our server uses the code from within the client to communicate with it. Using Reflection, the server can load the assembly of the client to find the relevant functions and passwords.\nLoad the client assembly:\nprivate static System.Reflection.Assembly assembly = \nSystem.Reflection.Assembly.LoadFile(@\"C:\\Users\\user1\\Desktop\\Quasar\\ServerVersionLo\nadClient\\resource.bin.open.exe\");\nEncryption:\nRather straight forward, as the server version uses the same API as the sample client.\nGet the AES class:\nprivate static Type tAES = assembly.GetType(\"_.Cr.Crp.AES\");\n\n\nGetting the setDefKey, encrypt and decrypt methods:\nprivate static System.Reflection.MethodInfo[] mi = tAES.GetMethods(); \nprivate static System.Reflection.MethodInfo setDefKey = mi[1]; \/\/ this one is used \nto set the current encryption key (IE sha256 of the password stored in Settings)\n\/\/tAES.GetMethod(\"Encrypt\"); doesn\u2019t work, because its ambiguous as it is overridden, so I choose the right ones directly\nprivate static System.Reflection.MethodInfo encMIBuf = mi[4];\nprivate static System.Reflection.MethodInfo decMIBuf = mi[6];\n\nReplace the server functions:\npublic static void SetDefaultKey(string key) \n\nwith\npublic static void setDefKey.Invoke(null, new object[] { key });\n\npublic static byte[] Encrypt(byte[] input) \n\nwith\npublic static byte[] encdata = (byte[])encMIBuf.Invoke(null, new object[] { input \n});\n\npublic static byte[] Decrypt(byte[] input) \n\nwith\npublic static byte[] data = (byte[])decMIBuf.Invoke(null, new object[] { input });\n\nSerialization:\nThis was more complex. Both the client and server uses the same API, but the client serializer cannot serialize server objects, because they are not the same as their \"mirrored\" objects inside the client. In some cases these objects are completely different, for example the server commands to get the file system.\n\nOur solution is to:\n\n \tTranslate on the fly the objects the server send to mirrored matching client objects (will not work if client doesn\u2019t have this object, or renamed it).\n \tCopy the content from the server object into the new client object (will not work if client implementation is different).\n \tSerialize the client object (which will be later encrypted and sent).\n \tDeserialize the decrypted response into another client response object.\n \tTranslate the client response object into the server version of the client response object.\n \tCopy the contents from the client response object into the translated server object.\n \tReturn the translated object.\n\npublic static void SerializeWrapper(Stream stream, object data) \n{ \nSystem.Reflection.Assembly assembly = System.Reflection.Assembly.LoadFile(@\"C:\\Users\\user1\\Desktop\\Quasar\\ServerVersionL\noadClient\\resource.bin.open.exe\");\n Type serializerType = assembly.GetType(\"_.Cr.NetSerializer.Serializer\");\n System.Reflection.PropertyInfo serInstanceProp = serializerType.GetProperty(\"Instace\");\n object serInstance = serInstanceProp.GetGetMethod().Invoke(null, new object[] { });\n System.Reflection.MethodInfo serializeMet = serializerType.GetMethod(\"Serialize\");\n Type typeOfData = data.GetType(); string typeOfDataFullName = typeOfData.FullName;\n string typeOfDataFullNameNew = typeOfDataFullName.Replace(\"xServer.Core\", \"_.Cr\");\n Type packType = assembly.GetType(typeOfDataFullNameNew);\n object pacTypeInstance = packType.GetConstructor(new Type[] { }).Invoke(new object[] { }); \n\/\/ now try to copy data into the instance \nforeach (FieldInfo fieldOfClient in packType.GetFields()) \n{ \nstring fieldName = fieldOfClient.Name;\n FieldInfo fieldOfServer = typeOfData.GetField(fieldName);\n PropertyInfo PropOfServer = typeOfData.GetProperty(fieldName);\n object serverValue = null;\n if (fieldOfServer != null) { \nserverValue = fieldOfServer.GetValue(data);\n } else if (PropOfServer != null) { \nserverValue = PropOfServer.GetValue(data,null);\n } fieldOfClient.SetValue(pacTypeInstance, serverValue); \n} \nforeach (PropertyInfo fieldOfClient in packType.GetProperties()) \n{ \nstring fieldName = fieldOfClient.Name;\n FieldInfo fieldOfServer = typeOfData.GetField(fieldName);\n PropertyInfo PropOfServer = typeOfData.GetProperty(fieldName);\n object serverValue = null;\n if (PropOfServer != null) {\n serverValue = PropOfServer.GetValue(data, null); \n} \nelse if (fieldOfServer != null) {\n serverValue = fieldOfServer.GetValue(data);\n } \nfieldOfClient.SetValue(pacTypeInstance, serverValue,null); \n} \nserializeMet.Invoke(serInstance, new object[] { stream, pacTypeInstance });

The IPacket, Serialization and Encryption framework code is shared between the client and the server, therefore we can use it with Reflection. However the Server handlers and command function are not, so we cannot create a completely perfect simulation.\nInitial handshake\nAfter the TCP handshake completes, the server starts another handshake with the client by sending packets in the following order (Figure 9):\n\n\n\nFigure 9- Initial Handshake\n\nThe client returns data to the server about the victim computer, which is displayed in the server GUI (Figure 10):\n\n\n\nFigure 10- Quasar RAT Server GUI\n\nThe server and client then enter into a keep-alive mode, where the attacker can send commands to the client and receive further responses.\nRAT commands\nThe attacker can issue commands (not all commands appear in different samples) through the Quasar server GUI for each client:\n\n \tGet system information\n \tGet file system\n \tUpload \/ download \/ execute files\n \tStartup manager\n \tOpen task manager\n \tKill \/ start processes\n \tEdit registry\n \tReverse Proxy\n \tShutdown \/ restart the computer\n \tOpen remote desktop connection\n \tObserve the desktop and actions of active user\n \tIssue remote mouse clicks and keyboard strokes\n \tPassword stealing\n \tRetrieve Keylogger logs\n \tVisit website\n \tDisplay a message box\n\nOur server build was able to successfully execute most of the commands.\n\nThe file system commands underling handlers and IPacket were modified to support more features, so these commands don\u2019t work out of the box and required manual implementation from us.\nA Double-Edged Sword\u2026\nWith further analysis of the Quasar RAT C2 Server, we uncovered vulnerabilities in the server code, which would allow remote code execution. This might allow a second attacker to install code of their choice \u2013 for example, their own Quasar RAT \u2013 on the original attacker\u2019s server. We refer to this (somewhat ironic) technique as a \u201cDouble Edged Sword Attack\u201d. We did not apply this to any live C2 servers \u2013 we only tested this with our own servers in our lab.\n\nIn the lab, we changed our Quasar RAT source code to use the known encryption key, and to send fake victim IP address, City, Country code, Flag, and Username. The Quasar server does not verify the RAT data, and displays this data in the RAT Server GUI when the RAT is executed and connects to the server. We found this could be used to supply compelling \u201cvictim data\u201d to convince the attacker to connect to this \u201cvictim\u201d via the GUI.\n\nQuasar server includes a File Manager window, allowing the attacker to select victim files, and trigger file operations \u2013 for example, uploading a file from victim machine to server. Uploaded files are written to the server sub directory \u201cclients\\user_name@machine_name_ipaddress\u201d.\n\nQuasar server does not verify that the size, filename, extension, or header of the uploaded file is the same as requested. Therefore, if we convince the attacker to request the file \u201csecret_info.doc (20KB)\u201d, we can instead return to the server any file of our choice, of any size or type.\n\nWhen the Quasar server retrieves the name of the uploaded file from the victim, it does not verify that it is a valid file path. Therefore sending the file path \"..\\..\\ secret_info.doc \" will result in writing our file instead to the same directory as the Quasar server code.\n\nQuasar server does not even verify that a file was requested from the victim. Immediately when the File Manager window is opened by the attacker, the Quasar server sends two commands to the RAT: GetDrives and listDirectory (to populate the list of the victim\u2019s files in the RAT Server GUI). We can respond to those commands by instead sending two files of our choice to the Quasar server. Again, we control the content of the file, the size and the path and filename.\n\nQuasar is a .NET Framework assembly, loading multiple DLLs upon launch, for example \u201cdnsapi.dll\u201d. Quasar server is vulnerable to a simple DLL hijacking attack, by using this technique to replace server DLLs.\n\nWhen the attacker restarts the Quasar application, our uploaded \u201cdnsapi.dll\u201d will instead be loaded. Through this vector, we could drop our own Quasar client on the attacker\u2019s server and execute it. Our Quasar RAT will connect to our own (secured, of course) Quasar server, allowing us to control that attacker\u2019s server with his own RAT. We can also replace \u201cshfolder.dll\u201d (and add a DLL export proxy to avoid a crash), which is loaded whenever the attacker clicks the builder tab \u2013 allowing us to infect the server while it runs, without the need to wait for application restart.\nDowneks\nAlthough Downeks has been publicly examined to some extent, our analysis found several features not previously described.\n\nEarlier Downeks samples were all written in native code. However, among our Downeks samples, we found new versions apparently written in .NET. We observe many behavioral similarities and unique strings across both the native-Downeks versions, and the new .NET Downeks versions. Almost all of the strings and behaviors we describe in this analysis of a .NET version are also present in the native version.\n\nWe observed these samples deployed only against Hebrew-speaking targets.\nDowneks.NET \u2013 \u201cSharpDownloader\u201d\nDowneks .NET internal name is \u201cSharpDownloader\u201d, \u201cSharp\u201d may be a reference to the language it was written in \u2013 C#.\n\nAs seen in previous Downeks versions, it uses masquerades with icons, filenames and metadata imitating popular legitimate applications such as VMware workstation (Figure 1) and CCleaner, or common file formats such as DOC and PDF.\n\n\n\nFigure 11 - Application metadata masquerading as VMWare Workstation\n\nAll 3 samples were compiled with the same timestamp. Downeks.NET is obfuscated using \u201cYano\u201d and can be easily de-obfuscated using the de4dot utility.\nSHA256: 4dcf5bd2c7a5822831d9f22f46bd2369c4c9df17cc99eb29975b5e8ae7e88606\nSHA256: 905f6a62749ca6f0fd33345d6a8b1831d87e9fd1f81a59cd3add82643b367693\nSHA256: c885f09b10feb88d7d176fe1a01ed8b480deb42324d2bb825e96fe1408e2a35f\n\nCommunication\nDowneks is a backdoor with only very basic capabilities. It communicates with the C2 server using HTTP POST requests.\n\nIt runs in an infinite loop, in each iteration it requests a command from the C2, and then it sleeps for a time period it receives in the C2 response (defaulting to 1 second if no sleep-time sent).\n\nThe data that is sent in the POST is serialized with json, which is then is encrypted, and finally encoded in base64. The json format is typically {\u201cmth\u201d:\u201dsome_method\u201d, \u201cdata\u201d:\u201dsome_encrypted_data\u201d}. The C2 server responds using the same format and serialization\/encryption\/encoding.\nDownload and Execute\nAs described in earlier analyses, Downeks\u2019 main purpose is as a downloader. Unfortunately, we were unable to get any C2 servers to issue download commands to any samples that we tested in our lab.\n\nThe download is initiated upon receiving json with a \u201cdownload\u201d command, which includes the URL of the file to be downloaded. Downeks can also be instructed to execute binaries that already exist on the victim machine. After successful execution, Downeks returns the results to the C2 server.\n\nDowneks also has a self-update capability, if instructed by the C2.\nScreen Capture\nDowneks can be instructed with the \u201cimg\u201d command to capture the victim screen and transmit it back to the C2. The parameters \u201cwth\u201d and \u201cqlt\u201d specify \u201cwidth\u201d and \u201cquality\u201d.\nAppdata\nDowneks .NET creates a file in the \u201cAppdata\u201d directory, based on certain properties of the machine. During our analysis, Downeks created a file in \u201cAppdata\\Roaming\u201d containing only \u201cSD{new line} 0\u201d (\u201cSD\u201d possibly for \u201cSharpDownloader\u201d).\n\nAlthough this file itself is not particularly interesting, the older (native) Downeks versions also creates a file in Appdata\\Roaming, with identical data.\n\nThe filenames across the two variants bear striking similarities. The .NET variant creates \u201c1FABFBFF0000065132F71D94\u201d, while the native version creates \u201c000206511FABFBFF\u201d. We observed the string \u201c1FABFBFF0000065132F71D94\u201d in memory during debugging of the native variant (Figure 12). This is a pseudo-unique ID for each machine, based on install date taken from the registry, volume serial number, OS version and service pack, Processor architecture, and computer name.\n\n\n\nFigure 12 - Machine ID in memory\nInstalled Antivirus check\nDowneks enumerates any antivirus products installed on the victim machine and transmits the list to the C2. It constructs this list using the WMI query:\n\u201cSELECT displayName FROM AntivirusProduct\u201d\n\nPersistence\nDowneks achieves host persistence through either the registry \u201crun\u201d key or with a shortcut in the start-up folder.\nExternal IP\nIn another similarity between both variants, Dowenks assesses the victim\u2019s external IP using an HTTP request to http:\/\/www.myexternalip.com\/raw.\nOther commands\nDowneks can be instructed by the C2 to perform a few other commands:\n\n \tCheck if the computer name and user name, or external IP address, is in a provided list and if so, display a message box with a message as defined by the C2.\n \tKill any running process and attempt to delete the associated executable.\n \t\u201cSetup\u201d command \u2013 sends various info about the machine with each iteration of the C2 communications loop.\n\nEncryption keys\nDowneks has static encryption keys hardcoded in the code. These keys are initialized in the \u201cDefaults\u201d class constructor, suggesting that the author of this malware has great affection for stackoverflow:\nstatic Defaults()\n{\n    ResEncKey = Strings.Get(0x1524);       \/\/ resolves to \u201c$t2ck0v3rFl0w\u201d\n    RarPass = Strings.Get(0x1539);         \/\/ resolves to \u201c123456\u201d\n    ServerTransKey = Strings.Get(0x1542);  \/\/

\u201c1q@W3e$RQ!w2E#r4\u201d\n}\n\nTypos\nWe observed some typos in the code, such as \u201cresponce\u201d ( \u201cresponse\u201d) and \u201cGroubID\u201d (\u201cGroupID\u201d) in this version.\nCoverage &amp; IoCs\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from Downeks and Quasar used in this attack:\n\n \tWildFire properly classifies these Downeks and Quasar samples as

DustySky is a campaign which others have <a href="http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Operation%20DustySky_TLP_WHITE.pdf">attributed</a> to the Gaza Cybergang group, a group that targets <a href="http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2015/04/attacks-against-israeli-palestinian-interests.html">government interests</a> in the region.</p>
<p>This report shares our researchers’ analysis of the attack and Remote Access Tool (RAT). We also discovered during our research that the RAT Server used by this attacker is itself vulnerable to remote attack, a double-edged sword for these attackers.</p>
<h3>Attack</h3>
<p>The initial infection vector in this attack is not clear, but it results in installing the “Downeks” downloader, which in turn infects the victim computer with the “Quasar” RAT.</p>
<p>Downeks uses third party websites to determine the external IP of the victim machine, possibly to determine victim location with GeoIP. It also drops decoy documents in an attempt to camouflage the attack.</p>
<p>Quasar is a .NET Framework-based open-source RAT. The attackers invested significant effort in attempting to hide the tool by changing the source code of the RAT and the RAT server, and by using an obfuscator and packer.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>Unit 42 researchers observed the Quasar RAT being prevented from executing on a Traps-protected client in September 2016. We observed these Quasar samples:</p>

<p>Further research found other Quasar examples, an attack earlier in the month 2016 on the same target:</p>

<p>We found the same Quasar code in an additional attack on the same day, but upon a different target. A second Quasar sample was also observed attacking this new victim:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">SHA256: 99a7cb43fb2898810956b6137d803c8f97651e23f9f13e91887f188749bd5e8f</p>
<p>We do not have detailed visibility into the specific host attacked, and have not been able to reproduce the second stage of the attack in our lab. However, based upon the timeframe of subsequent telemetry we observe, we understand the attack chain as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The initial dropper (which varies across attacks) is delivered to the victim via email or web:</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">File Name: Joint Ministerial Council between the GCC and the EU Council.exe&#8221;<br />

<li>The initial dropper, upon execution, extracts an embedded Downeks instance:</li>

<ol start="3">
<li>Downeks makes a POST request to dw.downloadtesting[.]com, resulting in the installation of the Quasar RAT on the victim machine.</li>
<li>Additional Downeks downloaders connecting to the previously-observed server dw.downloadtesting[.]com were also found in this attack:</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">SHA256: 15abd32342e87455b73f1e2ecf9ab10331600eb4eae54e1dfc25ba2f9d8c2e8a</p>

<p>Further research identified dozens of Dowenks and Quasar samples related to these attackers. All included decoy documents written in Arabic (all related to Middle Eastern politics) or Hebrew. Most of them use the same mutex structure, share the same fake icon and unique metadata details, file writes, registry operations, and fake common program metadata, as seen in DustySky samples.</p>
<p>The Downeks downloader and Quasar C2 infrastructures are each self-contained and independent of each other. However, we did find a single shared IP address demonstrably connecting the Downeks downloader and Quasar C2 infrastructure s. The below chart (Figure 1) shows Quasar infrastructure (top), Downeks (bottom), and the shared IP link.</p>

<p>In Figure 2, top-right (green) has the Quasar infrastructure (Figure 3), with a link to the Downeks infrastructure. Left (yellow) is DustySky infrastructure (Figure 4) and the links to this Downeks campaign. As well as similarities in the code, decoys and targets, we also identified C2 infrastructure links between DustySky and this campaign. The remainder is sub-campaigns of Downeks samples, their infrastructure, their links – and a favored ISP (center) (Figure 5).</p>

<p><em>Figure 7- Builds by day-of-the-week</em></p>
<p>We saw five samples built on the same date in December 2015, and six on the same date in January, further solidifying the link between each sample.</p>
<h3>Quasar</h3>
<p>We analyzed a Quasar sample we found that was communicating with an active C2 server at the time of analysis:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">SHA256: 4393ff391396cdfd229517dd98aa7faecad04da479fe8ca322f035ceee363273</p>
<p>Quasar is a publicly-available commodity RAT, an evolution of his earlier xRAT, by German developer “MaxXor”. This sample is a modified version of Quasar, most likely forked from open source version 1.2.0.0 on <a href="https://github.com/quasar/QuasarRAT/tree/v1.2.0.0">GitHub</a>. The client was likely built using the Quasar server client builder. We observed the following customizations:</p>
<p>C2 server:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">app.progsupdate[.]com, which resolved to 185.141.25[.]68), over port 4664.</p>
<p>Quasar mutex name:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">VMFvdCsC7RFqerZinfV0sxJFo</p>
<p>Keylogger log location:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Users\hJTQwqwwSCkZU\AppData\Roaming\GoogleDesktop\&lt;date&gt;</p>
<p>The malware uses fake version information to appear as a Microsoft update program, as well as Google Desktop once unpacked.</p>

<h3>Packer</h3>
<p>This sample is packed by “Netz”, a simple .NET Framework packer which stores the original executable compressed (zlib) as a resource. At runtime, the packer decompresses the resource and uses Reflection to load the assembly, find its Entry point, and Invoke it. Extracting the payload is straight forward – we simply dump the resource and decompress it. After decompilation, the packer looks like this:</p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<p>This layer uses obfuscation in an attempt to avoid detection/analysis.</p>
<h3>Obfuscation</h3>
<p>We discovered that the sample was obfuscated using .NET reactor. It is possible to decompile the deobfuscated sample and retrieve most of the original source code but not enough to compile it easily.</p>
<p>After deobfuscation we extracted:</p>

<h4>Cryptography</h4>
<p>The sample we analyzed is using RijndaelManaged with ECB mode and PKCS7 padding. The key is the SHA256 hash of the hard-coded password. The password of the sample we analyzed is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“6y7u^Y&amp;U6y7u^Y&amp;U6y7u^Y&amp;U”</p>
<p>Although at first glance this appears somewhat complex, it is in fact a rather simple, repeated keyboard sequence. We observe similar keyboard patterns in other samples: “567%^&amp;”, “zxc!@#ASD”.</p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<h4>Serialization</h4>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Quasar contains the NetSerializer library that handles serialization of high level IPacket objects that the client and server use to communicate. The serialization assigns unique IDs for serializable objects types. The open source and several other samples we found give a dynamically-assigned 1 byte ID at compile time. The sample we analyzed changed that behavior and hard-coded DWORD for each object type. </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">This is a better implementation, as it allows servers and clients from different versions to communicate with each other to some extent.</span></p>

<h4>Version</h4>
<p>The sample we analyzed is most likely forked from open source quasar 1.2.0.0. We find multiple file/object names hinting at the version, but must compelling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quasar version 1.1.0.0 names the encryption module name space &#8220;Encryption&#8221;, while subsequent Quasar versions use &#8220;Cryptography&#8221; – which we observe in this sample.</li>
<li>Quasar version 1.3.0.0 changed the encryption key generation, and stopped saving the password in the sample. There are more indications as well, such as names of objects, files etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other samples we analyzed had different combinations of modification to cryptography and serialization.</p>
<h3>The C2 server</h3>
<p>Our decompilation of the serialization library was not complete enough to allow simple recompilation. Instead, we downloaded and compiled the 1.2.0.0 server of the open-source Quasar RAT, having determined that this seemed likely the most similar version. The out-of-the-box server could not communicate with the client sample owing to the previously documented modifications that we had observed. We incorporated those changes into our build, discovering that this worked for most sample versions with almost no further modification.</p>
<p>Both the client and the server use the same code to serialize and encrypt the communications. Instead of compiling a different server for each client, our server uses the code from within the client to communicate with it. Using Reflection, the server can load the assembly of the client to find the relevant functions and passwords.</p>
<h4>Load the client assembly:</h4>

<h3>Serialization:</h3>
<p>This was more complex. Both the client and server uses the same API, but the client serializer cannot serialize server objects, because they are not the same as their &#8220;mirrored&#8221; objects inside the client. In some cases these objects are completely different, for example the server commands to get the file system.</p>
<p>Our solution is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Translate on the fly the objects the server send to mirrored matching client objects (will not work if client doesn’t have this object, or renamed it).</li>
<li>Copy the content from the server object into the new client object (will not work if client implementation is different).</li>
<li>Serialize the client object (which will be later encrypted and sent).</li>
<li>Deserialize the decrypted response into another client response object.</li>
<li>Translate the client response object into the server version of the client response object.</li>
<li>Copy the contents from the client response object into the translated server object.</li>
<li>Return the translated object.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Communication</h3>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri;">Our sample communicates with app.progsupdate[.]com, which resolved to 185.141.25[.]68, over TCP port 4664.</span></p>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>This is the communication architecture between quasar client and server (Figure 8):</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Quasar_11.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23696" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Quasar_11.png" alt="quasar_11" width="405" height="273" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Quasar_11.png 405w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Quasar_11-300x202.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Quasar_11-370x249.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px" /></a></p>
<p><em>Figure 8- Communication Architecture</em></p>
<ol>
<li>The server sends a command. for example, “Get System Information”.</li>
<li>The command is translated to an IPacket of type GetSystemInfo.</li>
<li>The packet is serialized into a stream of bytes.</li>
<li>The stream of bytes is encrypted (in some versions there is also optional compression step).</li>
<li>The stream of bytes is sent over TCP to the client.</li>
<li>The client receives and decrypts the packet.</li>
<li>The client deserializes the packet into IPacket GetSystemInfo.</li>
<li>The relevant handler of the client is called, collects the system information and sends it back inside IPacket of GetSystemInfoResponse.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these layers seems to be different to some extent in the various samples we found. The IPacket, Serialization and Encryption framework code is shared between the client and the server, therefore we can use it with Reflection. However the Server handlers and command function are not, so we cannot create a completely perfect simulation.</p>
<h3>Initial handshake</h3>
<p>After the TCP handshake completes, the server starts another handshake with the client by sending packets in the following order (Figure 9):</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Quasar_12.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23693" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Quasar_12.png" alt="quasar_12" width="517" height="486" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Quasar_12.png 517w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Quasar_12-300x282.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Quasar_12-370x348.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 517px) 100vw, 517px" /></a></p>
<p><em>Figure 9- Initial Handshake</em></p>
<p>The client returns data to the server about the victim computer, which is displayed in the server GUI (Figure 10):</p>

<p><em>Figure 10- Quasar RAT Server GUI</em></p>
<p>The server and client then enter into a keep-alive mode, where the attacker can send commands to the client and receive further responses.</p>
<h3>RAT commands</h3>
<p>The attacker can issue commands (not all commands appear in different samples) through the Quasar server GUI for each client:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get system information</li>
<li>Get file system</li>
<li>Upload / download / execute files</li>
<li>Startup manager</li>
<li>Open task manager</li>
<li>Kill / start processes</li>
<li>Edit registry</li>
<li>Reverse Proxy</li>
<li>Shutdown / restart the computer</li>
<li>Open remote desktop connection</li>
<li>Observe the desktop and actions of active user</li>
<li>Issue remote mouse clicks and keyboard strokes</li>
<li>Password stealing</li>
<li>Retrieve Keylogger logs</li>
<li>Visit website</li>
<li>Display a message box</li>
</ul>
<p>Our server build was able to successfully execute most of the commands.</p>
<p>The file system commands underling handlers and IPacket were modified to support more features, so these commands don’t work out of the box and required manual implementation from us.</p>
<h3>A Double-Edged Sword…</h3>
<p>With further analysis of the Quasar RAT C2 Server, we uncovered vulnerabilities in the server code, which would allow remote code execution. This might allow a second attacker to install code of their choice – for example, their own Quasar RAT – on the original attacker’s server. We refer to this (somewhat ironic) technique as a “Double Edged Sword Attack”. We did not apply this to any live C2 servers – we only tested this with our own servers in our lab.</p>
<p>In the lab, we changed our Quasar RAT source code to use the known encryption key, and to send fake victim IP address, City, Country code, Flag, and Username. The Quasar server does not verify the RAT data, and displays this data in the RAT Server GUI when the RAT is executed and connects to the server. We found this could be used to supply compelling “victim data” to convince the attacker to connect to this “victim” via the GUI.</p>
<p>Quasar server includes a File Manager window, allowing the attacker to select victim files, and trigger file operations – for example, uploading a file from victim machine to server. Uploaded files are written to the server sub directory “clients\user_name@machine_name_ipaddress”.</p>
<p>Quasar server does not verify that the size, filename, extension, or header of the uploaded file is the same as requested. Therefore, if we convince the attacker to request the file “secret_info.doc (20KB)”, we can instead return to the server any file of our choice, of any size or type.</p>
<p>When the Quasar server retrieves the name of the uploaded file from the victim, it does not verify that it is a valid file path. Therefore sending the file path &#8220;..\..\ secret_info.doc &#8221; will result in writing our file instead to the same directory as the Quasar server code.</p>
<p>Quasar server does not even verify that a file was requested from the victim. Immediately when the File Manager window is opened by the attacker, the Quasar server sends two commands to the RAT: GetDrives and listDirectory (to populate the list of the victim’s files in the RAT Server GUI). We can respond to those commands by instead sending two files of our choice to the Quasar server. Again, we control the content of the file, the size and the path and filename.</p>
<p>Quasar is a .NET Framework assembly, loading multiple DLLs upon launch, for example “dnsapi.dll”. Quasar server is vulnerable to a simple DLL hijacking attack, by using this technique to replace server DLLs.</p>
<p>When the attacker restarts the Quasar application, our uploaded “dnsapi.dll” will instead be loaded. Through this vector, we could drop our own Quasar client on the attacker’s server and execute it. Our Quasar RAT will connect to our own (secured, of course) Quasar server, allowing us to control that attacker’s server with his own RAT. We can also replace “shfolder.dll” (and add a DLL export proxy to avoid a crash), which is loaded whenever the attacker clicks the builder tab – allowing us to infect the server while it runs, without the need to wait for application restart.</p>
<h3>Downeks</h3>
<p>Although Downeks has been publicly examined to some extent, our analysis found several features not previously described.</p>
<p>Earlier Downeks samples were all written in native code. However, among our Downeks samples, we found new versions apparently written in .NET. We observe many behavioral similarities and unique strings across both the native-Downeks versions, and the new .NET Downeks versions. Almost all of the strings and behaviors we describe in this analysis of a .NET version are also present in the native version.</p>

<h4>Downeks.NET – “SharpDownloader”</h4>
<p>Downeks .NET internal name is “SharpDownloader”, “Sharp” may be a reference to the language it was written in – C#.</p>
<p>As seen in previous Downeks versions, it uses masquerades with icons, filenames and metadata imitating popular legitimate applications such as VMware workstation (Figure 1) and CCleaner, or common file formats such as DOC and PDF.</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>Downeks is a backdoor with only very basic capabilities. It communicates with the C2 server using HTTP POST requests.</p>
<p>It runs in an infinite loop, in each iteration it requests a command from the C2, and then it sleeps for a time period it receives in the C2 response (defaulting to 1 second if no sleep-time sent).</p>
<p>The data that is sent in the POST is serialized with json, which is then is encrypted, and finally encoded in base64. The json format is typically {“mth”:”some_method”, “data”:”some_encrypted_data”}. The C2 server responds using the same format and serialization/encryption/encoding.</p>
<h3>Download and Execute</h3>
<p>As described in earlier analyses, Downeks’ main purpose is as a downloader. Unfortunately, we were unable to get any C2 servers to issue download commands to any samples that we tested in our lab.</p>
<p>The download is initiated upon receiving json with a “download” command, which includes the URL of the file to be downloaded. Downeks can also be instructed to execute binaries that already exist on the victim machine. After successful execution, Downeks returns the results to the C2 server.</p>
<p>Downeks also has a self-update capability, if instructed by the C2.</p>
<h3>Screen Capture</h3>
<p>Downeks can be instructed with the “img” command to capture the victim screen and transmit it back to the C2. The parameters “wth” and “qlt” specify “width” and “quality”.</p>
<h3>Appdata</h3>
<p>Downeks .NET creates a file in the “Appdata” directory, based on certain properties of the machine. During our analysis, Downeks created a file in “Appdata\Roaming” containing only “SD{new line} 0” (“SD” possibly for “SharpDownloader”).</p>
<p>Although this file itself is not particularly interesting, the older (native) Downeks versions also creates a file in Appdata\Roaming, with identical data.</p>
<p>The filenames across the two variants bear striking similarities. The .NET variant creates “1FABFBFF0000065132F71D94”, while the native version creates “000206511FABFBFF”. We observed the string “1FABFBFF0000065132F71D94” in memory during debugging of the native variant (Figure 12). This is a pseudo-unique ID for each machine, based on install date taken from the registry, volume serial number, OS version and service pack, Processor architecture, and computer name.</p>

<p><em>Figure 12 &#8211; Machine ID in memory</em></p>
<h3>Installed Antivirus check</h3>
<p>Downeks enumerates any antivirus products installed on the victim machine and transmits the list to the C2. It constructs this list using the WMI query:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“SELECT displayName FROM AntivirusProduct”</p>
<h3>Persistence</h3>
<p>Downeks achieves host persistence through either the registry “run” key or with a shortcut in the start-up folder.</p>
<h3>External IP</h3>
<p>In another similarity between both variants, Dowenks assesses the victim’s external IP using an HTTP request to http://www.myexternalip.com/raw.</p>
<h3>Other commands</h3>
<p>Downeks can be instructed by the C2 to perform a few other commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if the computer name and user name, or external IP address, is in a provided list and if so, display a message box with a message as defined by the C2.</li>
<li>Kill any running process and attempt to delete the associated executable.</li>
<li>“Setup” command – sends various info about the machine with each iteration of the C2 communications loop.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Encryption keys</h3>
<p>Downeks has static encryption keys hardcoded in the code. These keys are initialized in the “Defaults” class constructor, suggesting that the author of this malware has great affection for stackoverflow:</p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->
