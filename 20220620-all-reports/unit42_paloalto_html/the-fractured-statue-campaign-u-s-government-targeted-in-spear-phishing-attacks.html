The malware families used in this campaign consisted mainly of malicious documents featuring CARROTBAT downloaders with SYSCON payloads, but also included a new malware downloader Unit 42 has dubbed CARROTBALL.\r\n\r\nCARROTBALL, initially discovered in an attack during October 2019, is a simple FTP downloader utility which facilitates the installation of SYSCON, a full-featured Remote Access Trojan (RAT) which leverages FTP for Command and Control (C2). It was found embedded in a malicious Word document sent as a phishing lure to a US government agency and two non-US foreign nationals professionally associated with North Korea.\r\n\r\nThroughout the course of the campaign, Unit 42 ultimately observed a total of six unique malicious document lures being sent as attachments from four unique Russian email addresses to 10 unique targets. The subject matter of the lures featured articles written in Russian pertaining to ongoing geopolitical relations issues surrounding North Korea. Of those malicious documents, five contained CARROTBAT downloaders, and one contained a CARROTBALL downloader. All malicious second stage payloads were SYSCON.\r\n\r\nWhile this campaign does demonstrate some evolution in the actor\u2019s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) with the use of a new downloader family and new malicious code in the form of Word Document macros, the majority of its attributes bear a strong resemblance to the Fractured Block campaign previously reported by Unit 42 in November 2018. As such, Unit 42 has dubbed this campaign Fractured Statue. The Adversary Playbook for the activity described in this blog can be found here.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1. Fractured Statue Campaign Timeline\r\n\r\nOpening Wave of Attacks\r\nBetween July 15th, 2019 and July 17th, 2019, spear phishing emails were sent to a total of five individuals at a US government agency from the email addresses 0tdelkorei@mail[.]ru and kargarnova@mail[.]ru. The spear phishing emails utilized three different email subjects with malicious macro documents attached with the same name; all file names were written in Russian. Further, all of the malicious documents contained articles written in Russian pertaining to ongoing geopolitical relations issues surrounding North Korea. The documents themselves were rather generic and had no embedded image enticements to enable macros. They did, however, leverage second-stage downloader components consistent with known CARROTBAT samples, and almost all of them featured SYSCON payloads. The first pages of each of these documents are shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2.

One attack featured the same sender and malicious document but had a different subject and filename.

Sixth phishing attempt details.\r\n\r\nFinal Attempt\r\nOn October 29, 2019, one of the same individuals targeted in the second wave of attacks was targeted again with a malicious document, though in this attack the sender was different and the document lure did not feature CARROTBAT. Also of note is that the lure in this attack did feature a more traditional \u201cenable macro\u201d cover page, but was then followed by additional pages in Russian that thematically matched with the documents found in the rest of the campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7.

Seventh phishing attempt details.\r\nAlso interesting to note is that the sender added multiple recipients to their email; one was an individual at a US government agency, and the other two individuals were non-US foreign nationals professionally associated with ongoing activities in North Korea.\r\nTechnical Analysis\r\nWith the exception of the October 2019 attack, all of the malicious documents found in this campaign featured the following macro code snippet of interest:\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8. Macro from malicious documents associated with CARROTBAT.\r\nWhen executed, this code will:\r\n\r\n \tDetermine whether the victim\u2019s host machine is running Windows with an x86 or x64 architecture.\r\n \tParse the contents of a corresponding textbox within the document and convert it to a command line argument specific to the Windows architecture on the victim\u2019s machine.\r\n \tExecute the command.\r\n \tClear the contents of the textboxes and save the document.\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, all samples featuring the macros above also featured CARROTBAT as a second stage downloader.\r\n\r\nThe October 2019 attack, however, differed significantly from the previous ones. Instead of reading from the contents of the document itself, the macros leveraged an embedded Windows executable in the form of hex bytes delimited via the \u2018|\u2019 character that ultimately acted as a dropper. When the macro was executed, the hex bytes were split, converted to binary, and dropped onto disk as an executable. The first few lines of this functionality are shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 9. Macro from malicious documents associated with CARROTBALL.\r\nIn this case, the dropped binary was a new type of downloader we have dubbed CARROTBALL. Its sole purpose was to serve as the main mechanism to facilitate the download and installation of the SYSCON backdoor. This is very similar to the CARROTBAT samples observed earlier on in this campaign and in the previous Fractured Block campaign (see technical analysis here). Additionally, of novel interest in this attack was the use of two separate FTP credential pairs to conduct active C2 operations. One credential pair was hardcoded in the dropped CARROTBALL binary and used to connect to the domain downplease.c1[.]biz to retrieve a CAB file renamed with a generic .dat extension.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 10. Observed CARROTBALL FTP interaction.\r\nWhen extracted, the .cab file was found to contain two malicious batch files, two malicious dlls (one of which contained a custom base64 alphabet), and a second domain (lookplease.c1[.]biz) with a set of FTP login credentials encoded in the custom base64 alphabet. The contents of the cab file are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 11.

SYSCON C2 file attributes.\r\nAt the time of the activity, both downplease.c1[.]biz and lookplease.c1[.]biz resolved to the IP address 185.176.43[.]94.\r\nAttribution\r\nKonni: Malware or Actor?\r\nOriginally, the name \u201cKonni\u201d was used to refer to a Remote Access Trojan utilized in targeted campaigns with strong links to North Korean interests. However, as additional campaigns began to appear with strongly overlapping TTPs yet did not feature the Konni RAT, specifically, some industry researchers simply began to adopt the \u201cKonni\u201d moniker to refer to the actors behind the aggregated set of activity. Unit 42 has followed this trend, and now refers to the \u201cKonni Group\u201d as such.\r\nKonni\u2019s Ties to Fractured Statue\r\nAs prominently documented by Cisco Talos, the first Konni Group activity was a sustained information stealing\/RAT distribution campaign spanning between 2014 and 2017. Throughout 2018, Unit 42 released several blogs on Konni Group activity, and subsequently identified two new malware families the group was using in the attacks, dubbed NOKKI and CARROTBAT, respectively. Now, in 2019, Unit 42\u2019s continued observation of targeted CARROTBAT activity (in addition to the new malware CARROTBALL being used during the same campaign) could indicate that both are still in use by the Konni Group, as thematically linked elements of Konni Group TTPs include:\r\n\r\n \tTargeting individuals\/organizations who have interest in, are directly linked to, or conduct business in North Korea (corroborated by previous research by Unit 42).\r\n \tUtilizing malicious document phishing lures containing subject matter pertaining to North Korea (corroborated by previous research by Unit 42).\r\n \tIteratively increasing the type and complexity of their payload delivery mechanisms (from their initial use of simple Base64 strings as reported by Trend Micro, then later leveraging CARROTBAT, and now leveraging CARROTBALL)\r\n\r\nHowever, there are non-trivial obstacles to obtaining a high-confidence attribution to the Konni Group, namely the fact that previous blogs produced by Unit 42 and other researchers contain a great deal of technical detail about the group\u2019s operations, and copycat actors may attempt to emulate previously observed TTPs to hinder attribution efforts or perform false-flag operations.\r\n\r\nIn light of these factors, Unit 42 assesses with moderate confidence that this activity is related to the Konni Group.\r\nConclusion\r\nOverall, the Fractured Statue campaign provides clear evidence that the TTPS discovered in Fractured Block are still relevant, and that the group behind the attacks still appears to be active. Additionally, development and use of the new downloader, CARROTBALL, alongside the more commonly observed malware delivery mechanism, CARROTBAT, may indicate that the previous methods employed by the group to successfully infect their targets are becoming less effective.

<p>Between July and October 2019, Unit 42 observed several malware families typically associated with the Konni Group (see <a href="#Attribution">Attribution</a> section below for more details) used to primarily target a US government agency, using the ongoing and heightened geopolitical relations issues surrounding North Korea to lure targets into opening malicious email attachments. The malware families used in this campaign consisted mainly of malicious documents featuring CARROTBAT downloaders with SYSCON payloads, but also included a new malware downloader Unit 42 has dubbed CARROTBALL.</p>
<p>CARROTBALL, initially discovered in an attack during October 2019, is a simple FTP downloader utility which facilitates the installation of SYSCON, a full-featured Remote Access Trojan (RAT) which leverages FTP for Command and Control (C2). It was found embedded in a malicious Word document sent as a phishing lure to a US government agency and two non-US foreign nationals professionally associated with North Korea.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of the campaign, Unit 42 ultimately observed a total of six unique malicious document lures being sent as attachments from four unique Russian email addresses to 10 unique targets. The subject matter of the lures featured articles written in Russian pertaining to ongoing geopolitical relations issues surrounding North Korea. Of those malicious documents, five contained CARROTBAT downloaders, and one contained a CARROTBALL downloader. All malicious second stage payloads were SYSCON.</p>
<p>While this campaign does demonstrate some evolution in the actor’s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) with the use of a new downloader family and new malicious code in the form of Word Document macros, the majority of its attributes bear a strong resemblance to the Fractured Block campaign <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-the-fractured-block-campaign-carrotbat-malware-used-to-deliver-malware-targeting-southeast-asia/">previously reported by Unit 42 in November 2018</a>. As such, Unit 42 has dubbed this campaign Fractured Statue.

<h3>Opening Wave of Attacks</h3>
<p>Between July 15th, 2019 and July 17th, 2019, spear phishing emails were sent to a total of five individuals at a US government agency from the email addresses <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">0tdelkorei@mail[.]ru</span> and <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">kargarnova@mail[.]ru</span>. The spear phishing emails utilized three different email subjects with malicious macro documents attached with the same name; all file names were written in Russian. Further, all of the malicious documents contained articles written in Russian pertaining to ongoing geopolitical relations issues surrounding North Korea. The documents themselves were rather generic and had no embedded image enticements to enable macros. They did, however, leverage second-stage downloader components consistent with known CARROTBAT samples, and almost all of them featured SYSCON payloads. The first pages of each of these documents are shown below:</p>

<h3>Second Wave</h3>
<p>Roughly one month later, beginning on August 15, 2019 and ending on September 14, 2019, the second wave of CARROTBAT attacks occurred against three additional email addresses at the same government agency. One attack featured the same sender and malicious document but had a different subject and filename. The other two emails contained a previously unseen malicious document and featured a mix of Russian and English languages in both the document lures and the email correspondence.</p>

<h3>Final Attempt</h3>
<p>On October 29, 2019, one of the same individuals targeted in the second wave of attacks was targeted again with a malicious document, though in this attack the sender was different and the document lure did not feature CARROTBAT. Also of note is that the lure in this attack did feature a more traditional “enable macro” cover page, but was then followed by additional pages in Russian that thematically matched with the documents found in the rest of the campaign.</p>

<p>Also interesting to note is that the sender added multiple recipients to their email; one was an individual at a US government agency, and the other two individuals were non-US foreign nationals professionally associated with ongoing activities in North Korea.</p>
<h3>Technical Analysis</h3>
<p>With the exception of the October 2019 attack, all of the malicious documents found in this campaign featured the following macro code snippet of interest:</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Figure-8.-Macro-from-malicious-documents-associated-with-CARROTBAT..png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-103420" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Figure-8.-Macro-from-malicious-documents-associated-with-CARROTBAT..png" alt="" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Figure-8.-Macro-from-malicious-documents-associated-with-CARROTBAT..png 748w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Figure-8.-Macro-from-malicious-documents-associated-with-CARROTBAT.-300x200.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Figure-8.-Macro-from-malicious-documents-associated-with-CARROTBAT.-370x246.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Figure 8. Macro from malicious documents associated with CARROTBAT.</em></span></p>
<p>When executed, this code will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine whether the victim’s host machine is running Windows with an x86 or x64 architecture.</li>
<li>Parse the contents of a corresponding textbox within the document and convert it to a command line argument specific to the Windows architecture on the victim’s machine.</li>
<li>Execute the command.</li>
<li>Clear the contents of the textboxes and save the document.</li>
</ul>
<p>As previously mentioned, all samples featuring the macros above also featured CARROTBAT as a second stage downloader.</p>
<p>The October 2019 attack, however, differed significantly from the previous ones. Instead of reading from the contents of the document itself, the macros leveraged an embedded Windows executable in the form of hex bytes delimited via the ‘|’ character that ultimately acted as a dropper. When the macro was executed, the hex bytes were split, converted to binary, and dropped onto disk as an executable. The first few lines of this functionality are shown below:</p>

<p>In this case, the dropped binary was a new type of downloader we have dubbed CARROTBALL. Its sole purpose was to serve as the main mechanism to facilitate the download and installation of the SYSCON backdoor. This is very similar to the CARROTBAT samples observed earlier on in this campaign and in the previous Fractured Block campaign (see technical analysis <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-the-fractured-block-campaign-carrotbat-malware-used-to-deliver-malware-targeting-southeast-asia/">here</a>). Additionally, of novel interest in this attack was the use of two separate FTP credential pairs to conduct active C2 operations. One credential pair was hardcoded in the dropped CARROTBALL binary and used to connect to the domain <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">downplease.c1[.]biz</span> to retrieve a CAB file renamed with a generic .dat extension.</p>

<h3><a id="Attribution"></a>Attribution</h3>
<h5><strong>Konni: Malware or Actor?</strong></h5>
<p>Originally, the name “Konni” was used to refer to a Remote Access Trojan utilized in targeted campaigns with strong links to North Korean interests. However, as additional campaigns began to appear with strongly overlapping TTPs yet did not feature the Konni RAT, specifically, some industry researchers simply began to adopt the “Konni” moniker to refer to the actors behind the aggregated set of activity. Unit 42 has followed this trend, and now refers to the “Konni Group” as such.</p>
<h5><strong>Konni’s Ties to Fractured Statue</strong></h5>
<p>As prominently <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/05/konni-malware-under-radar-for-years.html">documented by Cisco Talos</a>, the first Konni Group activity was a sustained information stealing/RAT distribution campaign spanning between 2014 and 2017. Throughout 2018, Unit 42 released several blogs on Konni Group activity, and subsequently identified two new malware families the group was using in the attacks, dubbed <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-new-konni-malware-attacking-eurasia-southeast-asia/">NOKKI</a> and <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-the-fractured-block-campaign-carrotbat-malware-used-to-deliver-malware-targeting-southeast-asia/">CARROTBAT</a>, respectively. Now, in 2019, Unit 42’s continued observation of targeted CARROTBAT activity (in addition to the new malware CARROTBALL being used during the same campaign) could indicate that both are still in use by the Konni Group, as thematically linked elements of Konni Group TTPs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Targeting individuals/organizations who have interest in, are directly linked to, or conduct business in North Korea (corroborated by previous research by Unit 42).</li>
<li>Utilizing malicious document phishing lures containing subject matter pertaining to North Korea (corroborated by previous research by Unit 42).</li>
<li>Iteratively increasing the type and complexity of their payload delivery mechanisms (from their initial use of simple Base64 strings <a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/syscon-backdoor-uses-ftp-as-a-cc-channel/">as reported by Trend Micro</a>, then later leveraging CARROTBAT, and now leveraging CARROTBALL)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are non-trivial obstacles to obtaining a high-confidence attribution to the Konni Group, namely the fact that previous blogs produced by Unit 42 and other researchers contain a great deal of technical detail about the group’s operations, and copycat actors may attempt to emulate previously observed TTPs to hinder attribution efforts or perform false-flag operations.</p>
<p>In light of these factors, Unit 42 assesses with moderate confidence that this activity is related to the Konni Group.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, the Fractured Statue campaign provides clear evidence that the TTPS discovered in Fractured Block are still relevant, and that the group behind the attacks still appears to be active. Additionally, development and use of the new downloader, CARROTBALL, alongside the more commonly observed malware delivery mechanism, CARROTBAT, may indicate that the previous methods employed by the group to successfully infect their targets are becoming less effective.
