A closer look revealed the malware, which we\u2019ve dubbed \u201cLucifer\u201d, is capable of conducting DDoS attacks and well-equipped with all kinds of exploits against vulnerable Windows hosts. The first wave of the campaign stopped on June 10, 2020. The attacker then resumed their campaign on June 11, 2020, spreading an upgraded version of the malware and wreaking havoc. The sample was compiled on Thursday, June 11, 2020 10:39:47 PM UTC and caught by Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall. At the time of writing, the campaign\u2019s still ongoing.\r\n\r\nLucifer is quite powerful in its capabilities. Not only is it capable of dropping XMRig for cryptojacking Monero, it\u2019s also capable of command and control (C2) operation and self-propagation through the exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities and credential brute-forcing. Additionally, it drops and runs EternalBlue, EternalRomance, and DoublePulsar backdoor against vulnerable targets for intranet infections.\r\n\r\nThe exhaustive list of weaponized exploits includes CVE-2014-6287, CVE-2018-1000861, CVE-2017-10271, ThinkPHP RCE vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-20062), CVE-2018-7600, CVE-2017-9791, CVE-2019-9081, PHPStudy Backdoor RCE, CVE-2017-0144, CVE-2017-0145, and CVE-2017-8464. These vulnerabilities have either \u201chigh\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d ratings due to their trivial-to-exploit nature and their tremendous impact inflicted on the victim. Once exploited, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the vulnerable device. In this case, the targets are Windows hosts on both the internet and intranet, given that the attacker is leveraging certutil utility in the payload for malware propagation. Fortunately, the patches for these vulnerabilities are readily available.\r\n\r\nWhile the vulnerabilities abused and attack tactics leveraged by this malware are nothing original, they once again deliver a message to all organizations, reminding them why it\u2019s utterly important to keep systems up-to-date whenever possible, eliminate weak credentials, and have a layer of defenses for assurance.\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing this blog, the XMR wallet has paid 0.493527 XMR, which converts to approximately $32 USD.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewalls can detect and block all the exploit attempts from this kind of malware family.\r\n\r\nThis blog includes a detailed analysis of Lucifer and the comparison of version 1 and version 2.\r\nLucifer: Cryptojacking and DDoS Campaign\r\nA quick note on the name: While the malware author named their malware Satan DDoS, there\u2019s another malware, Satan Ransomware, bearing that devious name already. An alternative alias was given to this malware to avoid confusion. As a result of staying faithful to the unique strings in the binary, we are calling this Lucifer.\r\n\r\nWe identified two versions of Lucifer in our research - we focus first on version 1 and then highlight the changes made to version 2 in the following section.\r\n\r\nLucifer contains three resource sections, each of which contains a binary for a specific purpose. The X86 resource section contains a UPX-packed x86 version of XMRig 5.5.0. The X64 resource section contains a UPX-packed x64 version of XMRig 5.5.0. The SMB section contains a binary, in which there\u2019s a lot of Equation Group\u2019s exploits like EternalBlue and EternalRomance, and of course the infamous DoublePulsar backdoor implant.\r\n\r\nX86: 8edbcd63def33827bfd63bffce4a15ba83e88908f9ac9962f10431f571ba07a8\r\n\r\nX64: Ac530d542a755ecce6a656ea6309717ec222c34d7e34c61792f3b350a8a29301\r\n\r\nSMB: 5214f356f2e8640230e93a95633cd73945c38027b23e76bb5e617c71949f8994\r\n\r\nUpon execution, the malware first decrypts its C2 IP address using a xor-incremental encryption and then creates a mutant, using its C2 IP address as the mutant\u2019s name.\r\n\r\nThe decrypted C2 IP address is 122[.]112[.]179[.]189.\r\n\r\nThe name of the mutant object is \\Sessions\\1\\BaseNamedObjects\\122[.]112[.]179[.]189\r\n\r\nThe pseudo-code for the decryption algorithm is shown in the figure below.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_107771\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"478\"] Figure 1. Decryption routine[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe malware then proceeds to persist itself by setting the following registry key values.\r\n\r\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\QQMusic - %malware binary path%\r\n\r\nHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\QQMusic - %malware binary path%\r\n\r\nThe binary also uses schtasks to set up itself as a task running periodically, ensuring additional layer of persistence. The command executed is shown in Figure 2.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_107773\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"] Figure 2. Execution of schtasks[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOnce the malware has persisted itself, it then checks whether there\u2019s any existing stratum mining information stored in the following registry key value:\r\n\r\nHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\spreadCpuXmr - %stratum info%\r\n\r\nThe mining information stored in this registry key value takes precedence if the data is present and legit. Otherwise, the malware falls back to its default data embedded in the binary.\r\n\r\nThe malware enables itself with debug privilege and starts several threads to carry out its operation in concurrent fashion. The following table summarizes the function of each thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFunction Address\r\nDescription\r\n\r\n\r\n0x0041C970\r\nClear event logs, remove a log file, terminate the miner process, and repeat its cleaning routine every 18000 second.\r\n\r\n\r\n0x00414B60\r\nCollect interface info and send miner status to its C2 server.\r\n\r\n\r\n0x00419BC0\r\nCheck the remote address and remote port of all TCP connections. If there\u2019s a match and the connection-owning process is not the malware itself and the process\u2019s module path is not C:\\ProgramData\\spreadXfghij.exe, the malware kills that process and deletes that file. The allow list of ports and IP address are in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n0x0041A780\r\nGet or initialize its miner parameter, kill miner and Taskmgr process if necessary, drop the miner binary, and execute the miner binary with the values of the arguments based on the host\u2019s memory usage. Both the x86 or x64 bit version of the miner is saved as C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\spreadXfghij.exe\r\n\r\n\r\n0x00418DC0\r\nPropagate through brute-forcing credentials and exploitation. Also drop the Equation Group\u2019s exploits and launch them to propagate through exploiting years old SMB vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n0x0041C840\r\nCopy and save the malware as C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\spread.txt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1. Worker Thread Description\r\nThe malware employs different propagation strategies.\r\n\r\nThe malware scans for both open TCP ports 135 (RPC) and 1433(MSSQL) against the target, be it internal or external, and probes for the credential weakness in attempt to gain unauthorized access.\r\n\r\nIf the target has the RPC port open, the malware brute-forces the login using the default username administrator and its embedded password list. It then copies and runs the malware binary on the remote host upon successful authentication.\r\n\r\nWhen the malware detects that the target has TCP port 1433 open, it tries to brute-force its way in using its embedded list of usernames and passwords. Upon successful login, the malware then issues shell commands to download and execute a replica of itself on the victim. The aforementioned list of usernames and passwords can be found in the appendix section.\r\n\r\nIn addition to brute-forcing the credentials, the malware leverages exploitation for self-propagation. For intranet infection, it drops and runs EternalBlue, EternalRomance, and DoublePulsar backdoor against the target when the target has TCP port 445 (SMB) open. Upon successful exploitation, certutil is used to propagate the malware.\r\n\r\nThe following figures show the parameters passed to launch the exploits and the backdoor implant.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_107775\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"] Figure 3. EternalBlue and DoublePulsar combo (for non-XP targets)[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_107777\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"] Figure 4. EternalBlue and DoublePulsar combo (for XP targets)[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_107779\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"] Figure 5. EternalRomance and DoublePulsar combo (all targets)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn order to infect external hosts, the malware first generates a non-private IP address, and then probes this randomly-selected victim with HTTP requests over a number of ports. The list of ports is available in the Appendix. When the malware receives a valid HTTP response from the victim, it then tries to exploit the target based on the conditions shown in the following table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCondition\r\nExploit\r\n\r\n\r\nHFS found in the HTTP response\r\nCVE-2014-6287\r\n\r\n\r\nJetty found in the HTTP response\r\nCVE-2018-1000861\r\n\r\n\r\nServlet found in the HTTP response\r\nCVE-2017-10271\r\n\r\n\r\nNo keywords found in the HTTP response\r\nThinkPHP remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities\r\n\r\nCVE-2018-7600\r\n\r\nCVE-2017-9791\r\n\r\nCVE-2019-9081\r\n\r\nPHPStudy Backdoor remote code execution (RCE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 2. Exploit conditions and CVEs\r\nSince the same vulnerability (e.g ThinkPHP RCE) may be triggered in different endpoints (i.e via different URLs), the malware tries all hardcoded URLs against the victim for each vulnerability before it proceeds to the next target or next exploit attempt.\r\n\r\nAll the exploits contain the payload that downloads a replica of the malware onto the victim via certutil. The following figures show examples of the attack traffic.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_107710\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"] Figure 6. CVE-2019-9081 traffic[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_107712\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"] Figure 7. ThinkPHP RCE traffic[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAfter the malware has launched all its worker threads, the malware enters an infinite loop to handle its C2 operation, with a sleep interval of five seconds.\r\n\r\nAn example of the initial request to its C2 server is shown in Figure 8.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_107714\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"615\"] Figure 8. Initial request to C2 server[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOnce the malware has established a TCP connection with its C2 server on port 15888, the malware saves that same socket for subsequent C2 control as well as the miner\u2019s status report.\r\n\r\nThe initial C2 request contains a magic header \\x04\\x02\\x02 and encrypted system information like the host IP address, the system type, system architecture, username, number of processors, and processor frequency. The malware does a decremental-xor encryption on this piece of information before it sends the encrypted data over the wire. The encrypted data can be decrypted using the decryption routine described in Figure 1. For example, the decrypted host IP address in Figure 8 is 192.168.56[.]52. The decrypted Windows system is Windows 7 64Bit, and the decrypted username is Lebron James.\r\n\r\nUnlike its very first C2 request message, the rest of the miner\u2019s status report messages are actually clear text. An example packet of the miner\u2019s status report is shown in Figure 9 below.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_107716\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"601\"] Figure 9. Miner\u2019s status report sent to C2 Server[\/caption]\r\n\r\nTable 3 summarizes the control codes received from the C2 server and their corresponding functionalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC2 Command\r\nDescription\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\nPerform TCP\/UDP\/HTTP DoS attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\nReenable DoS attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\nDownload and execute a file from its C2 server. The file\u2019s saved as %TEMP%\\&lt;4 random lower case characters&gt;.exe\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\nExecute the received command from its C2 server.\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\nDisable the miner\u2019s status report functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\nEnable the miner\u2019s status report functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\nSet the data of the registry key value HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\spreadCpuXmr, and terminate the miner process.\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\nEnable both flags related to is_miner_killed and start_fresh\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\nReset flags and terminate the miner process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 3. C2 description\r\nThe communication between the cryptojacking bot and its mining server is made by using the Stratum protocol on port 10001 and is controlled by the execution of the spreadXfghij.exe program. This program accepts different parameters that control configuration settings of the running miner such as username, password, CPU usage, priority, threads, and algorithm names respectively.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_107781\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"] Figure 10. XMRig Command-Line parameters[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Stratum protocol is mainly used by miner software to connect to a centralized server, which coordinates the workload between the clients. This protocol satisfies the requirements of the JSON RPC 2.0 specification. The JSON-RPC requests and responses can be seen in Figure 11.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_107718\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"] Figure 11. Lucifer bot exchanging the mining information.[\/caption]\r\nLucifer: Version 2\r\nVersion 2 of Lucifer is similar to its predecessor in terms of its overall capabilities and behaviors; It drops XMRig for cryptojacking, handles C2 operation, and propagates itself through exploitation and brute-forcing credentials.\r\n\r\nWhile version 2 and version 1 share a lot of behavioral similarities, version 2 does have exclusive differences that are worth highlighting.\r\n\r\nThe malware possesses anti-sandbox capability by checking the username and the computer name of the infected host. If it finds a match in its predefined list of names as shown in Table 4, the malware halts itself from proceeding further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNMSDBOX\r\nAvira\r\n\r\n\r\nWILBERT-SC\r\nCOMPUTERNAME\r\n\r\n\r\nXPAMASTC\r\nCWSX\r\n\r\n\r\nKappa\r\nVBOX\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXX-OS\r\ncuckoo\r\n\r\n\r\ncwsx-\r\nnmsdbox\r\n\r\n\r\nqemu\r\nsandbox\r\n\r\n\r\nvirtual\r\nwilbert-sc\r\n\r\n\r\nxpamast-sc\r\nxxxx - ox\r\n\r\n\r\ncuckoosandbox\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 4. List of Names\r\nLucifer also checks for the presence of following device drivers, DLLs, and virtual devices. If any of these objects are detected, the malware enters an infinite loop, stopping its execution from going further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSbieDrv.sys\r\nSandboxie.sys\r\n\r\n\r\nSbieDll.dll\r\nVBoxHook.dll\r\n\r\n\r\n\\\\.\\VBoxMiniRdrDN\r\nDir_watch.dll\r\n\r\n\r\n\\\\.\\pipe\\cuckoo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 5. List of Driver Names\r\nIn addition to its anti-sandbox techniques, version 2 possesses an anti-debugger technique that can thwart the analysis by passing a format string to OutputDebugStringA() and crashing the debugger.\r\n\r\nOnce Lucifer has passed all the checks, it decrypts its C2 URL and creates a mutex based on its C2 URL. The new C2 URL is qf2020[.]top, and the decryption algorithm is shown in Figure 1.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s an additional LNK resource section, in which there\u2019s a CVE-2017-8464 exploit used for infection. The binaries in the resource section are encrypted using the aforementioned xor-incremental encryption.

If it is, the malware sets Internet Explorer's Start Page to www[.]yzzswt[.]com, and starts a thread that keeps killing and visiting that URL in Internet Explorer. The trigger depends on the system's idle time.\r\n\r\nWhile Lucifer version 2 has new C2 at qf2020[.]top:19370, its C2 operation is still the same.\r\nConclusion\r\nLucifer is a new hybrid of cryptojacking and DDoS malware variant that leverages old vulnerabilities to spread and perform malicious activities on Windows platforms. Applying the updates and patches to the affected software are strongly advised. The vulnerable software includes Rejetto HTTP File Server, Jenkins, Oracle Weblogic, Drupal, Apache Struts, Laravel framework, and Microsoft Windows. Strong passwords are also encouraged to prevent dictionary attacks.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from the attacks by the following products and services:\r\n\r\n \t\r\n\r\n \tNext-Generation Firewalls with Threat Prevention licenses can block the exploits and C2 traffic with best practice configuration.\r\n \tWildFire can stop the malware with static signature detections.\r\n \tAutoFocus customers can track this activity with the Lucifer tag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIoCs (Lucifer Version1)\r\nNBI\r\nMalware Hosting

<p>On May 29, 2020, Unit 42 researchers discovered a new variant of a hybrid cryptojacking malware from numerous incidents of <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9081">CVE-2019-9081</a> exploitation in the wild. A closer look revealed the malware, which we’ve dubbed “Lucifer”, is capable of conducting DDoS attacks and well-equipped with all kinds of exploits against vulnerable Windows hosts. The first wave of the campaign stopped on June 10, 2020. The attacker then resumed their campaign on June 11, 2020, spreading an upgraded version of the malware and wreaking havoc. The sample was compiled on Thursday, June 11, 2020 10:39:47 PM UTC and caught by Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall. At the time of writing, the campaign’s still ongoing.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Lucifer</span> is quite powerful in its capabilities. Not only is it capable of dropping <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">XMRig</span> for cryptojacking Monero, it’s also capable of command and control (C2) operation and self-propagation through the exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities and credential brute-forcing. Additionally, it drops and runs EternalBlue, EternalRomance, and DoublePulsar backdoor against vulnerable targets for intranet infections.</p>
<p>The exhaustive list of weaponized exploits includes <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-6287">CVE-2014-6287</a>, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000861">CVE-2018-1000861</a>, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-10271">CVE-2017-10271</a>, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20062">ThinkPHP RCE vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-20062)</a>, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7600">CVE-2018-7600</a>, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9791">CVE-2017-9791</a>, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9081">CVE-2019-9081</a>, <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48192">PHPStudy Backdoor RCE</a>, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-0144">CVE-2017-0144</a>, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-0145">CVE-2017-0145</a>, and <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8464">CVE-2017-8464</a>. These vulnerabilities have either “high” or “critical” ratings due to their trivial-to-exploit nature and their tremendous impact inflicted on the victim. Once exploited, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the vulnerable device. In this case, the targets are Windows hosts on both the internet and intranet, given that the attacker is leveraging <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">certutil</span> utility in the payload for malware propagation. Fortunately, the patches for these vulnerabilities are readily available.</p>
<p>While the vulnerabilities abused and attack tactics leveraged by this malware are nothing original, they once again deliver a message to all organizations, reminding them why it’s utterly important to keep systems up-to-date whenever possible, eliminate weak credentials, and have a layer of defenses for assurance.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this blog, the XMR wallet has paid <strong>0.493527</strong> XMR, which converts to approximately $32 USD.</p>
<p>Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewalls can detect and block all the exploit attempts from this kind of malware family.</p>
<p>This blog includes a detailed analysis of <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Lucifer</span> and the comparison of version 1 and version 2.</p>
<h4>Lucifer: Cryptojacking and DDoS Campaign</h4>
<p>A quick note on the name: While the malware author named their malware <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Satan DDoS</span>, there’s another malware, <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Satan Ransomware</span>, bearing that devious name already. An alternative alias was given to this malware to avoid confusion. As a result of staying faithful to the unique strings in the binary, we are calling this <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Lucifer</span>.</p>
<p>We identified two versions of <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Lucifer</span> in our research &#8211; we focus first on version 1 and then highlight the changes made to version 2 in the following section.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Lucifer</span> contains three resource sections, each of which contains a binary for a specific purpose. The <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">X86</span> resource section contains a UPX-packed x86 version of <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">XMRig 5.5.0</span>. The <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">X64</span> resource section contains a UPX-packed x64 version of <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">XMRig</span> <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">5.5.0</span>. The <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">SMB</span> section contains a binary, in which there’s a lot of <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Equation Group’s</span> exploits like <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">EternalBlue</span> and <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">EternalRomance</span>, and of course the infamous <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">DoublePulsar</span> backdoor implant.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">X86: 8edbcd63def33827bfd63bffce4a15ba83e88908f9ac9962f10431f571ba07a8</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">X64: Ac530d542a755ecce6a656ea6309717ec222c34d7e34c61792f3b350a8a29301</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">SMB: 5214f356f2e8640230e93a95633cd73945c38027b23e76bb5e617c71949f8994</span></p>
<p>Upon execution, the malware first decrypts its C2 IP address using a xor-incremental encryption and then creates a mutant, using its C2 IP address as the mutant’s name.</p>
<p>The decrypted C2 IP address is <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">122[.]112[.]179[.]189</span>.</p>
<p>The name of the mutant object is <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">\Sessions\1\BaseNamedObjects\122[.]112[.]179[.]189</span></p>
<p>The pseudo-code for the decryption algorithm is shown in the figure below.</p>
<figure id="attachment_107771" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-107771" style="width: 478px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Figure-1.-Decryption-routine-1.jpg" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="size-full wp-image-107771" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Figure-1.-Decryption-routine-1.jpg" alt="Lucifer Decryption routine" width="478" height="294" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-107771" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1. Decryption routine</figcaption></figure>
<p>The malware then proceeds to persist itself by setting the following registry key values.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\QQMusic &#8211; %malware binary path%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\QQMusic &#8211; %malware binary path%</span></p>
<p>The binary also uses <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">schtasks</span> to set up itself as a task running periodically, ensuring additional layer of persistence. The command executed is shown in Figure 2.</p>
<figure id="attachment_107773" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-107773" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Figure-2.-Execution-of-schtasks.jpg" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="wp-image-107773" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Figure-2.-Execution-of-schtasks.jpg" alt="Execution of schtasks in Lucifer" width="600" height="60" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-107773" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2. Execution of schtasks</figcaption></figure>
<p>Once the malware has persisted itself, it then checks whether there’s any existing stratum mining information stored in the following registry key value:</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\spreadCpuXmr &#8211; %stratum info%</span></p>
<p>The mining information stored in this registry key value takes precedence if the data is present and legit. Otherwise, the malware falls back to its default data embedded in the binary.</p>
<p>The malware enables itself with debug privilege and starts several threads to carry out its operation in concurrent fashion. The following table summarizes the function of each thread.</p>
<table style="width: 100%;">

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Table 1. Worker Thread Description</em></span></p>
<p>The malware employs different propagation strategies.</p>
<p>The malware scans for both open TCP ports <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">135</span> (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">RPC</span>) and <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">1433(MSSQL)</span> against the target, be it internal or external, and probes for the credential weakness in attempt to gain unauthorized access.</p>
<p>If the target has the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">RPC</span> port open, the malware brute-forces the login using the default username <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">administrator</span> and its embedded password list. It then copies and runs the malware binary on the remote host upon successful authentication.</p>
<p>When the malware detects that the target has TCP port <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">1433</span> open, it tries to brute-force its way in using its embedded list of usernames and passwords. Upon successful login, the malware then issues shell commands to download and execute a replica of itself on the victim. The aforementioned list of usernames and passwords can be found in the appendix section.</p>
<p>In addition to brute-forcing the credentials, the malware leverages exploitation for self-propagation. For intranet infection, it drops and runs <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">EternalBlue</span>, <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">EternalRomance</span>, and <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">DoublePulsar</span> backdoor against the target when the target has TCP port <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">445 (SMB)</span> open. Upon successful exploitation, <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">certutil</span> is used to propagate the malware.</p>
<p>The following figures show the parameters passed to launch the exploits and the backdoor implant.</p>

<p>In order to infect external hosts, the malware first generates a non-private IP address, and then probes this randomly-selected victim with HTTP requests over a number of ports. The list of ports is available in the Appendix. When the malware receives a valid HTTP response from the victim, it then tries to exploit the target based on the conditions shown in the following table.</p>
<table style="width: 100%;">

<p>Since the same vulnerability (e.g ThinkPHP RCE) may be triggered in different endpoints (i.e via different URLs), the malware tries all hardcoded URLs against the victim for each vulnerability before it proceeds to the next target or next exploit attempt.</p>
<p>All the exploits contain the payload that downloads a replica of the malware onto the victim via <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">certutil</span>. The following figures show examples of the attack traffic.</p>

<p>After the malware has launched all its worker threads, the malware enters an infinite loop to handle its C2 operation, with a sleep interval of five seconds.</p>
<p>An example of the initial request to its C2 server is shown in Figure 8.</p>
<figure id="attachment_107714" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-107714" style="width: 615px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/word-image-29-1.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="wp-image-107714 size-full" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/word-image-29-1.png" alt="" width="615" height="226" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-107714" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 8. Initial request to C2 server</figcaption></figure>
<p>Once the malware has established a TCP connection with its C2 server on port <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">15888</span>, the malware saves that same socket for subsequent C2 control as well as the miner’s status report.</p>
<p>The initial C2 request contains a magic header <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">\x04\x02\x02</span> and encrypted system information like the host IP address, the system type, system architecture, username, number of processors, and processor frequency. The malware does a decremental-xor encryption on this piece of information before it sends the encrypted data over the wire. The encrypted data can be decrypted using the decryption routine described in Figure 1. For example, the decrypted host IP address in Figure 8 is <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">192.168.56[.]52</span>. The decrypted Windows system is <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Windows 7 64Bit</span>, and the decrypted username is <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Lebron James</span>.</p>
<p>Unlike its very first C2 request message, the rest of the miner’s status report messages are actually clear text. An example packet of the miner’s status report is shown in Figure 9 below.</p>

<p>The communication between the cryptojacking bot and its mining server is made by using the Stratum protocol on port <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">10001</span> and is controlled by the execution of the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">spreadXfghij.exe</span> program. This program accepts different parameters that control configuration settings of the running miner such as username, password, CPU usage, priority, threads, and <a href="https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/blob/master/doc/ALGORITHMS.md">algorithm names</a> respectively.</p>

<h4>Lucifer: Version 2</h4>
<p>Version 2 of <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Lucifer</span> is similar to its predecessor in terms of its overall capabilities and behaviors; It drops <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">XMRig</span> for cryptojacking, handles C2 operation, and propagates itself through exploitation and brute-forcing credentials.</p>
<p>While version 2 and version 1 share a lot of behavioral similarities, version 2 does have exclusive differences that are worth highlighting.</p>
<p>The malware possesses anti-sandbox capability by checking the username and the computer name of the infected host. If it finds a match in its predefined list of names as shown in Table 4, the malware halts itself from proceeding further.</p>

<p>In addition to its anti-sandbox techniques, version 2 possesses an anti-debugger technique that can thwart the analysis by passing a format string to <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">OutputDebugStringA()</span> and crashing the debugger.</p>
<p>Once <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Lucifer</span> has passed all the checks, it decrypts its C2 URL and creates a mutex based on its C2 URL. The new C2 URL is <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">qf2020[.]top</span>, and the decryption algorithm is shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p>There’s an additional <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">LNK</span> resource section, in which there’s a CVE-2017-8464 exploit used for infection. The binaries in the resource section are encrypted using the aforementioned xor-incremental encryption. The decrypted <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">X86, X64,</span> and <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">SMB</span> binaries are the same as those embedded in version 1 of <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Lucifer</span>.</p>

<p>In contrast to version 1, version 2 of <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Lucifer</span> has added CVE-2017-8464 to its arsenal and taken out CVE-2018-1000861, CVE-2017-10271, and CVE-2017-9791.</p>
<p>The malware infects its targets through IPC, WMI, SMB, and FTP by brute-forcing the credentials, in addition to MSSQL, RPC, and network shares.</p>
<p>The dropped miner’s name is also different; it’s<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"> C:\\ProgramData\\Svchocpu.exe</span> instead of <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">C:\\ProgramData\\spreadXfghij.exe</span>.</p>
<p>Right before proceeding to its C2 operation, <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Lucifer</span> checks if the host&#8217;s default language is 0x804 (zh-CN). If it is, the malware sets <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Internet Explorer</span>&#8216;s Start Page to <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">www[.]yzzswt[.]com</span>, and starts a thread that keeps killing and visiting that URL in <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Internet Explorer</span>. The trigger depends on the system&#8217;s idle time.</p>
<p>While <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Lucifer</span> version 2 has new C2 at <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">qf2020[.]top:19370</span>, its C2 operation is still the same.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Lucifer</span> is a new hybrid of cryptojacking and DDoS malware variant that leverages old vulnerabilities to spread and perform malicious activities on Windows platforms. Applying the updates and patches to the affected software are strongly advised.
