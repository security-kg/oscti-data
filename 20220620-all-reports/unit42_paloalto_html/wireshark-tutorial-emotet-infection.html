Familiarity with Wireshark is necessary to understand this tutorial, which focuses on Wireshark version 3.x.\r\n\r\nEmotet is an information-stealer first reported in 2014 as banking malware. It has since evolved with additional functions such as a dropper, distributing other malware families like Gootkit, IcedID, Qakbot and Trickbot.\r\n\r\nToday\u2019s Wireshark tutorial reviews recent Emotet activity and provides some helpful tips on identifying this malware based on traffic analysis.\r\n\r\nNote: These instructions assume you have customized Wireshark as described in our previous Wireshark tutorial about customizing the column display.\r\n\r\nYou will need to access a GitHub repository with ZIP archives containing the pcaps used for this tutorial.\r\n\r\nWarning: Some of the pcaps used for this tutorial contain Windows-based malware. There is a risk of infection if using a Windows computer. If possible, we recommend you review these pcaps in a non-Windows environment like BSD, Linux or macOS.\r\nChain of Events for an Emotet Infection\r\nTo understand network traffic caused by Emotet, you must first understand the chain of events leading to an infection. Emotet is commonly distributed through malicious spam (malspam) emails. The critical step in an Emotet infection chain is a Microsoft Word document with macros designed to infect a vulnerable Windows host.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116676\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 1. Screenshot of a Word document used to cause an Emotet infection in January 2021.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nMalspam spreading Emotet uses different techniques to distribute these Word documents.\r\n\r\nThe malspam may contain an attached Microsoft Word document or have an attached ZIP archive containing the Word document. In recent months, we have seen several examples where these ZIP archives are password-protected. Some emails distributing Emotet do not have any attachments. Instead, they contain a link to download the Word document.\r\n\r\nIn previous years, malspam pushing Emotet has also used PDF attachments with embedded links to deliver these Emotet Word documents.\r\n\r\nFigure 2 illustrates these four distribution techniques.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116678\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 2. Various distribution paths for an Emotet Word document.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAfter the Word document is delivered, if a victim opens the document and enables macros on a vulnerable Windows host, the host is infected with Emotet.\r\n\r\nFrom a traffic perspective, we see the following steps from an Emotet Word document to an Emotet infection:\r\n\r\n \tWeb traffic to retrieve the initial binary.\r\n \tEncoded\/encrypted command and control (C2) traffic over HTTP.\r\n \tAdditional infection traffic if Emotet drops follow-up malware.\r\n \tSMTP traffic if Emotet uses the infected host as a spambot.\r\n\r\nFigure 3 shows a flowchart of network activity we might find during an Emotet infection.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116680\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 3. Flowchart for an Emotet infection.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nSince Dec. 21, 2020, the initial binary for Emotet has been a Windows DLL file. Previously, this binary had been a Windows EXE file.\r\n\r\nEmotet C2 traffic consists of encoded or otherwise encrypted data sent over HTTP. This C2 activity can use either standard or non-standard TCP ports associated with HTTP traffic. This C2 activity also consists of data exfiltration and traffic to update the initial Emotet binary.\r\n\r\nSince Emotet is also a malware dropper, the victim may become infected with other malware. Analysts should search for traffic from other malware when investigating traffic from an Emotet-infected host.\r\n\r\nFinally, an Emotet-infected host may also become a spambot generating large amounts of traffic over TCP ports associated with SMTP like TCP ports 25, 465 and 587.\r\nPcaps of Emotet Infection Activity\r\nFive password-protected ZIP archives containing pcaps of recent Emotet infection traffic are available at this GitHub repository. Once on the GitHub page, click on each of the ZIP archive entries and download them, as shown in Figures 4 and 5.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116682\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 4. GitHub repository with links to ZIP archives used for this tutorial.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116684\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 5. Downloading one of the ZIP archives for this tutorial.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nUse infected as the password to extract pcaps from these ZIP archives. This should give you the following five pcap files:\r\n\r\n \tExample-1-2021-01-06-Emotet-infection.pcap\r\n \tExample-2-2021-01-05-Emotet-with-spambot-traffic-part-1.pcap\r\n \tExample-3-2021-01-05-Emotet-with-spambot-traffic-part-2.pcap\r\n \tExample-4-2021-01-05-Emotet-infection-with-Trickbot.pcap\r\n \tExample-5-2020-08-18-Emotet-infection-with-Qakbot.pcap\r\n\r\nExample 1: Emotet Infection Traffic\r\nOpen Example-1-2021-01-06-Emotet-infection.pcap in Wireshark and use a basic web filter as described in our previous tutorial about Wireshark filters. The basic filter for Wireshark 3.x is:\r\n(http.request or tls.handshake.type eq 1) and !(ssdp)\r\nIf you\u2019ve set up Wireshark according to our initial tutorial about customizing Wireshark displays, your display should look similar to Figure 6.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116686\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 6. Our first pcap in this tutorial filtered in Wireshark.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAs shown in Figure 6, the first five HTTP GET requests represent four URLs used to retrieve the initial Emotet DLL. The traffic is:\r\n\r\n \thangarlastik[.]com GET \/cgi-bin\/Ui4n\/\r\n \thangarlastik[.]com GET \/cgi-sys\/suspendedpage.cgi\r\n \tpadreescapes[.]com GET \/blog\/0I\/\r\n \tsarture[.]com GET \/wp-includes\/JD8\/\r\n \tseo.udaipurkart[.]com GET \/rx-5700-6hnr7\/Sgms\/\r\n\r\nThe first two URLs indicate hangarlastik[.]com no longer had the Emotet DLL file it had been hosting. Follow TCP streams for each of these requests to see replies to each of the HTTP GET requests.\r\n\r\nAn easier way to see the HTTP responses is to update your Wireshark basic web filter to include HTTP responses:\r\n(http.request or http.response or tls.handshake.type eq 1) and !(ssdp)\r\nThis will show HTTP responses in the Info column, as illustrated in Figure 7.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116688\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 7. Adding HTTP responses to the Wireshark display filter.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nNow we have a clearer picture of what happened when the Word macro tried to retrieve an Emotet DLL:\r\n\r\n \thangarlastik[.]com GET \/cgi-bin\/Ui4n\/\r\n \tHTTP\/1.1 302 Found\r\n \thangarlastik[.]com GET \/cgi-sys\/suspendedpage.cgi\r\n \tHTTP\/1.1 200 OK\r\n \tpadreescapes[.]com GET \/blog\/0I\/\r\n \tHTTP\/1.1 401 Unauthorized\r\n \tsarture[.]com GET \/wp-includes\/JD8\/\r\n \tHTTP\/1.1 403 Forbidden\r\n \tseo.udaipurkart[.]com GET \/rx-5700-6hnr7\/Sgms\/\r\n\r\nThe only 200 OK was a reply for a suspended page notification from hangarlastik[.]com.\r\n\r\nThe HTTP GET request to seo.udaipurkart[.]com does not show a response, so follow the TCP stream for this request, as shown in Figure 8.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116690\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 8. Following TCP stream for the HTTP request to seo.udaipurkart[.]com.[\/caption]\r\nThe TCP stream shows indicators that seo.udaipurkart[.]com returned a Windows DLL file, as shown in Figure 9.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116692\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 9. Indicators of a DLL file returned from seo.udaipurkart[.]com.[\/caption]Export this DLL from the pcap by using the menu path: File --&gt; Export Objects --&gt; HTTP, as shown in Figure 10. As always, we recommend you do not export this file in a Windows environment, since the DLL is Windows-based malware.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116694\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 10. Exporting the Emotet DLL from our first pcap.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe SHA256 hash for this extracted DLL is:\r\n8e37a82ff94c03a5be3f9dd76b9dfc335a0f70efc0d8fd3dca9ca34dd287de1b\r\nEmotet C2 traffic is encoded data sent using HTTP POST requests. You can easily find these requests in Wireshark using the following filter:\r\nhttp.request.method eq POST\r\nThe results are shown in Figure 11.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116696\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 11. Filtering for HTTP POST requests in our first pcap.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn our first pcap, Emotet C2 traffic consists of HTTP POST requests to:\r\n\r\n \t5.2.136[.]90 over TCP port 80\r\n \t167.71.4[.]0 over TCP port 8080\r\n\r\nEmotet generates two types of HTTP POST requests for its C2 traffic. The first type of POST request ends with HTTP\/1.1. The second type of POST request ends with HTTP\/1.1 (application\/x-www-form-urlencoded).\r\n\r\nFollow the TCP stream for the initial HTTP request to 5.2.136[.]90 at 16:42:34 UTC to see an example of the first type of C2 POST request, as shown in Figure 12.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116698\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 12. The first type of HTTP POST request for Emotet C2 traffic.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nFigure 12 shows this POST request sends approximately 6 KB of form-data that appears to be an encoded or encrypted binary. Scroll down to the HTTP response to see encoded data returned from the server. Figure 13 shows the start of this encoded data.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116700\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 13. Encoded data returned from the server in response to the HTTP POST request.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThis type of encoded or encrypted data is how Emotet botnet servers exchange data with an infected Windows host. This is also the channel Emotet uses to update the Emotet DLL and drop follow-up malware.\r\n\r\nThe second type of HTTP POST request for Emotet C2 traffic looks noticeably different than the first type. Use the following filter in Wireshark to easily find the second type of HTTP POST request:\r\nurlencoded-form\r\nThis should return two HTTP POST requests to 167.71.4[.]0 over TCP port 8080, as shown in Figure 14.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116702\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 14. Filtering for the second type of HTTP POST request in Emotet C2 traffic.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nFollow the TCP stream for the first of these two HTTP POST requests at 16:58:43 UTC. Review the traffic. The results are shown in Figure 15.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116704\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 15. TCP stream for the second type of HTTP POST request in Emotet C2 traffic.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAs shown in Figure 15, some of the data sent in the POST request is encoded as a base64 string with some URL encoding. For example, %2B is used for a + symbol, %2F represents \/ and %3D is used for =.\r\n\r\nData sent in response from the server is encoded or otherwise encrypted.\r\n\r\nOur first pcap has no follow-up malware or other significant activity.\r\n\r\nThe only other activity is repeated connection attempts to 46.101.230[.]194 over TCP port 443. You can easily spot this activity by filtering on TCP SYN segments that are retransmissions. Use the following Wireshark filter:\r\ntcp.analysis.retransmission and tcp.flags eq 0x0002\r\nThe results are shown in Figure 16.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116706\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 16. Filtering on retransmissions of TCP SYN segments in Wireshark.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAn Internet search on 46.101.230[.]194 should reveal this IP address has been used for Emotet C2 activity.\r\n\r\nThe remaining traffic in the pcap is system traffic generated by a Microsoft Windows 10 host.\r\n\r\nIn our next pcap, we examine an Emotet infection with spambot activity.\r\nExample 2: Emotet With Spambot Traffic, Part 1\r\nOpen Example-2-2021-01-05-Emotet-with-spambot-traffic-part-1.pcap in Wireshark and use a basic web filter, as shown in Figure 17.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116708\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 17. Traffic from the second pcap filtered in Wireshark using our basic web filter.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nSimilar to our first example, we receive some HTTP GET requests before Emotet C2 traffic. These GET requests are attempts to download the initial Emotet DLL over web traffic. The first frame in the column display shows HTTPS traffic to obob[.]tv, which was probably a web request for the initial Emotet DLL, because this domain was reported as hosting an Emotet binary on Jan. 5, 2021, the same date as the traffic in our pcap.\r\n\r\nFollow the TCP stream for the HTTP GET request to miprimercamino[.]com to confirm it returned an Emotet DLL. You should see indicators similar to Figure 9 from our first pcap. We can export the Emotet DLL returned from miprimercamino[.]com, as shown in Figure 18.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116710\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 18. Exporting the Emotet DLL from the pcap.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe SHA256 hash for the extracted DLL from our second pcap is:\r\n963b00584d8d63ea84585f7457e6ddcac9eda54428a432f388a1ffee21137316\r\nAgain, we find two types of HTTP POST requests for Emotet C2 traffic. To filter for each type of Emotet C2 HTTP POST request, use the following Wireshark filters:\r\n\r\n \tFirst type: http.request method eq POST and !(urlencoded-form)\r\n \tSecond type: urlencoded-form\r\n\r\nFollow TCP streams for the HTTP POST requests returned by these filters and confirm they follow the same patterns seen in our first pcap.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing some examples of Emotet C2 traffic from this pcap, let\u2019s move on to the spambot activity.\r\n\r\nIn this example, our infected host was turned into a spambot, so we also have SMTP traffic. The spambot SMTP traffic is encrypted, but we can easily find it by using our basic web filter and scrolling down the column display.\r\n\r\nAt 20:06:20 UTC, the pcap starts showing SSL\/TLS traffic to TCP ports associated with the SMTP email protocol, like TCP ports 25, 465 and 587, as shown in Figure 19.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116712\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 19. Using the basic web filter and scrolling through the column display to find spambot traffic.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWe can filter on smtp to find some of the SMTP commands before encrypted SMTP tunnels are established. Figure 20 shows the results.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116714\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 20. Filtering for SMTP traffic in our second pcap.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWe can sometimes find unencrypted SMTP from spambot traffic generated by an Emotet-infected Windows host. Unencrypted SMTP will reveal its message content, but the volume of encrypted SMTP from a spambot host is far greater than the volume of unencrypted SMTP. Therefore, most of the spambot messages from an Emotet-infected host are hidden within the encrypted traffic.\r\n\r\nIn this example, you should only see encrypted SMTP traffic.\r\n\r\nBut our next example is later from this same infection, when we finally saw some unencrypted SMTP.\r\nExample 3: Emotet With Spambot Traffic, Part 2\r\nOpen Example-3-2021-01-05-Emotet-with-spambot-traffic-part-2.pcap in Wireshark and use a basic web filter, as shown in Figure 21.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116716\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 21. Traffic from the third pcap filtered in Wireshark using our basic web filter.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn this pcap, we still see HTTP POST requests for Emotet C2 traffic, at least twice each minute. We can also find encrypted spambot activity similar to our previous pcap.\r\n\r\nSpambot activity frequently generates a large amount of traffic. This pcap consists of 4 minutes and 42 seconds of spambot activity from the infected Windows host, and it\u2019s over 21 MB of traffic.\r\n\r\nWe can quickly identify any unencrypted SMTP traffic by using the following Wireshark filter:\r\nsmtp.data.fragment\r\nFigure 22 shows the results of this filter for our third pcap. The filter reveals five examples of Emotet malspam generated by the infected Windows host.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116718\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 22. Filtering for indicators of unencrypted SMTP from spambot traffic.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nFollow the TCP stream for the last email from: \"Gladisbel Miranda at 20:19:54 UTC. Examine what these messages look like, as shown in Figure 23.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116720\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 23. TCP stream for an example of Emotet malspam from our third pcap.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWe can export these five items of Emotet malspam by using the menu path File --&gt; Export Objects --&gt; IMF, as shown in Figure 24.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116722\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 24. Exporting Emotet malspam from our third pcap.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nExport these emails and examine them. Ideally, we recommend doing this in a non-Windows environment. Thunderbird is a free email client you can use to see how a potential victim might view these emails.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, Emotet is also a malware downloader. Perhaps the most common malware distributed through Emotet is Trickbot.\r\nExample 4: Emotet Infection with Trickbot\r\nOpen Example-4-2021-01-05-Emotet-infection-with-Trickbot.pcap in Wireshark and use a basic web filter, as shown in Figure 25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116724\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 25. Traffic from the fourth pcap filtered in Wireshark using our basic web filter.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThis pcap does not have an HTTP GET request for an initial Emotet DLL. However, the first frame in our column display shows HTTPS traffic to fathekarim[.]com. This was probably a web request for the Emotet DLL, because this domain was reported as hosting an Emotet binary on Jan. 5, 2021, the same date as the traffic in our pcap.\r\n\r\nYou should find the same two types of HTTP POST requests associated with Emotet C2, as described in our previous two pcaps.\r\n\r\nThis pcap also contains indicators of a Trickbot infection. Use your basic web filter and scroll down to find Trickbot traffic, as shown in Figure 26.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116726\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 26. Scrolling down the column display to find Trickbot indicators in our fourth pcap using a basic web filter.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve reviewed Trickbot in our previous Wireshark tutorial on examining Trickbot infections, but here is a quick refresher. The following are common indicators for Trickbot:\r\n\r\n \tHTTPS traffic over TCP ports 447 or 449 without an associated domain or hostname.\r\n \tHTTP POST requests over standard or non-standard TCP ports for HTTP traffic that end with \/81\/, \/83\/ or \/90, which are associated with data exfiltration.\r\n \tWith Trickbot from Emotet infections, the above HTTP POST requests start with \/mor followed by a number (only one or two digits seen so far).\r\n \tHTTP GET requests for URLs that end in .png that return additional Trickbot binaries.\r\n\r\nWe can easily find these indicators using the following Wireshark filters:\r\n\r\n \ttls.handshake.type eq 1 and (tcp.port eq 447 or tcp.port eq 449)\r\n \t(http.request.uri contains \/81 or http.request.uri contains \/83 or http.request.uri contains \/90) and http.request.uri contains mor\r\n \thttp.request.uri contains .png\r\n\r\nFigures 27-29 show the results from each of the above filters.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116728\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 27.: Filtering for Trickbot HTTPS traffic over TCP port 447 or TCP port 449.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116730\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 28. Filtering for HTTP POST requests associated with Trickbot data exfiltration.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nFollow TCP streams for each of the HTTP POST requests shown in Figure 28 to see if any password data was exfiltrated. The last HTTP POST request ending with \/90 contains data about the infected Windows host and its environment.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116732\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 29. Filtering for HTTP GET requests ending in .png associated with additional Trickbot binaries.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nFollow TCP streams for each of the HTTP POST requests shown in Figure 29 to see if any Windows binaries were returned. Doing so should reveal two Windows executable files. You can then export these binaries from the pcap using File --&gt; Export Objects --&gt; HTTP, as discussed in our previous examples.\r\n\r\nSHA256 hashes for these two Windows binaries (both EXE files) are:\r\n\r\n \t59e1711d6e4323da2dc22cdee30ba8876def991f6e476f29a0d3f983368ab461 for mingup.png\r\n \ted8dea5381a7f6c78108a04344dc73d5669690b7ecfe6e44b2c61687a2306785 for saved.png\r\n\r\nTrickbot is the most common malware distributed by Emotet, but it is not the only one. Qakbot is another type of malware frequently dropped on Emotet-infected Windows hosts.\r\nExample 5: Emotet Infection With Qakbot\r\nOpen Example-5-2020-08-18-Emotet-infection-with-Qakbot.pcap in Wireshark and use a basic web filter, as shown in Figure 30.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116734\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 30. Traffic from the fifth pcap filtered in Wireshark using our basic web filter.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn our fifth pcap, an Emotet Word document was retrieved from saketpranamam.mysquare[.]in at 21:23:50 UTC, which matches a URL reported as hosting an Emotet Word document on the same date. Export this Word document from the pcap using File --&gt; Export Objects --&gt; HTTP, as discussed in our previous examples.\r\n\r\nThe SHA256 hash for this extracted Word document is:\r\n\r\n \tc7f429dde8986a1b2fc51a9b3f4a78a92311677a01790682120ab603fd3c2fcb\r\n\r\nWe also see HTTPS traffic to samaritantec[.]com at 21:24:40 UTC. This domain was reported as hosting an Emotet binary on the same date.\r\n\r\nAs in our previous examples, you should find the same two types of HTTP POST requests associated with Emotet C2 traffic.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this pcap contains indicators of a Qakbot infection. Use your basic web filter and scroll down to find Qakbot traffic, as shown in Figure 31.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116736\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 31. Scrolling down the column display to find Qakbot indicators in our fifth pcap using a basic web filter.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve reviewed Qakbot in our previous Wireshark tutorial on examining Qakbot infections, but here is a quick refresher. The following are common indicators for Qakbot:\r\n\r\n \tHTTPS traffic over standard and non-standard TCP ports for HTTPS.\r\n \tCertificate data for Qakbot HTTPS traffic has unusual values for the issuer fields, and the certificate is not issued by an authority based in the United States.\r\n \tTCP traffic over TCP port 65400.\r\n \tPrior to late November 2020, Qakbot commonly generated HTTPS traffic to cdn.speedof[.]me.\r\n \tPrior to late November 2020, Qakbot commonly generated HTTP GET requests to a.strandsglobal[.]com.\r\n\r\nWe can easily find these indicators by using the following Wireshark filters:\r\n\r\n \ttls.handshake.type eq 11 and !(x509sat.CountryName == US)\r\n \ttcp.port eq 65400\r\n \ttls.handshake.extensions_server_name contains speedof\r\n \thttp.host contains strandsglobal\r\n\r\nFigures 32-35 show the results from each of the above filters.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116738\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 32. Filtering and searching for unusual certificate issuer data in HTTPS traffic generated by Qakbot.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn Figure 32, the results of our first filter show several frames in the column display for traffic from 71.80.66[.]107. Search through the frame details and find unusual certificate issuer data, as shown above.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116740\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 33. Filtering for Qakbot traffic over TCP port 65400.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn the above image, we find a single TCP stream of Qakbot traffic over TCP port 65400. This stream contains the public IP address and a botnet identification string for the Qakbot-infected Windows host.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116742\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 34. Filtering for traffic to cdn.speedof[.]me, which is not inherently malicious, but a connectivity check caused by Qakbot prior to late November 2020.[\/caption][caption id=\"attachment_116744\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Figure 35. Filtering for traffic to a.stransglobal[.]com, typically generated by Qakbot prior to late November 2020.[\/caption]While Emotet has commonly dropped Trickbot and Qakbot, be aware that Emotet has also dropped other types of malware such as Gootkit and IcedID.\r\nConclusion\r\nThis tutorial reviewed how to identify Emotet activity from pcaps of its infection traffic. We reviewed five recent pcaps and found similarities in HTTP POST requests caused by Emotet C2 traffic. The patterns are fairly unique and can be used to identify an Emotet infection within your network. We also reviewed other post-infection activities associated with Emotet, such as spambot traffic and different families of malware dropped on an infected host.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge can help security professionals better detect and catch an Emotet infection when reviewing suspicious network activity.\r\n\r\nFor more help with Wireshark, see our previous tutorials:\r\n\r\n \tChanging Your Column Display\r\n \tDisplay Filter Expressions\r\n \tIdentifying Hosts and Users\r\n \tExporting Objects from a Pcap\r\n \tExamining Trickbot Infections\r\n \tExamining Ursnif Infections\r\n \tExamining Qakbot Infections\r\n \tDecrypting HTTPS Traffic\r\n \tExamining Dridex Infection Traffic\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","@id":"#panworg"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/unit42.paloaltonetworks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/tutorial-900x512-150x150.png","width":150,"height":150},"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Brad Duncan"}]}</script><link rel='stylesheet' id='crayon-css'  href='https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/plugins/crayon-syntax-highlighter/css/min/crayon.min.css?ver=_2.7.2_beta' type='text/css' media='all' />

<p><a href="https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.emotet">Emotet</a> is an information-stealer <a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-banking-malware-uses-network-sniffing-for-data-theft/">first reported in 2014</a> as banking malware. It has since evolved with additional functions such as a dropper, distributing other malware families like <a href="https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Emotet+infections+and+followup+malware/24532/">Gootkit</a>, <a href="https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2019/01/18/index.html">IcedID</a>, <a href="https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2020/08/10/index.html">Qakbot</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1320847745155059712">Trickbot</a>.</p>
<p>Today’s Wireshark tutorial reviews recent Emotet activity and provides some helpful tips on identifying this malware based on traffic analysis.</p>
<p>Note: These instructions assume you have customized Wireshark as described in <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-customizing-wireshark-changing-column-display/">our previous Wireshark tutorial about customizing the column display</a>.</p>
<p>You will need to access a GitHub repository with ZIP archives containing <a href="https://github.com/pan-unit42/wireshark-tutorial-Emotet-traffic">the pcaps used for this tutorial</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Some of the pcaps used for this tutorial contain Windows-based malware. There is a risk of infection if using a Windows computer. If possible, we recommend you review these pcaps in a non-Windows environment like BSD, Linux or macOS.</p>
<h2>Chain of Events for an Emotet Infection</h2>
<p>To understand network traffic caused by Emotet, you must first understand the chain of events leading to an infection. Emotet is commonly distributed through malicious spam (malspam) emails. The critical step in an Emotet infection chain is a Microsoft Word document with macros designed to infect a vulnerable Windows host.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116676" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116676" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116676" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-30.jpeg" alt="This Word document shown was used to cause an Emotet infection in January 2021. Note the message in the screenshot: This document is protected. Previewing is not available for protected documents. You have to press &quot;ENABLE EDITING&quot; and &quot;ENABLE CONTENT&quot; buttons to preview this document. " width="900" height="734" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-116676" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1. Screenshot of a Word document used to cause an Emotet infection in January 2021.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Malspam spreading Emotet uses different techniques to distribute these Word documents.</p>
<p>The malspam may contain an attached Microsoft Word document or have an attached ZIP archive containing the Word document. In recent months, we have seen several examples where these ZIP archives are password-protected. Some emails distributing Emotet do not have any attachments. Instead, they contain a link to download the Word document.</p>
<p>In previous years, malspam pushing Emotet has also used PDF attachments with embedded links to deliver these Emotet Word documents.</p>
<p>Figure 2 illustrates these four distribution techniques.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116678" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116678" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116678" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-31.jpeg" alt="Distribution paths for Emotet Word document: 1) malspam with attachment to Word doc; 2) malspam with attachment to ZIP archive to Word doc; 3) malspam with link to web traffic to download Word doc to Word doc; 4) malspam with attachment to PDF file to web traffic to download Word doc to Word doc" width="900" height="870" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-116678" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2. Various distribution paths for an Emotet Word document.</figcaption></figure>
<p>After the Word document is delivered, if a victim opens the document and enables macros on a vulnerable Windows host, the host is infected with Emotet.</p>
<p>From a traffic perspective, we see the following steps from an Emotet Word document to an Emotet infection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web traffic to retrieve the initial binary.</li>
<li>Encoded/encrypted command and control (C2) traffic over HTTP.</li>
<li>Additional infection traffic if Emotet drops follow-up malware.</li>
<li>SMTP traffic if Emotet uses the infected host as a spambot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 3 shows a flowchart of network activity we might find during an Emotet infection.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116680" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116680" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116680" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-32.jpeg" alt="Flowchart for an Emotet infection: Word doc to enable macros to web traffic for initial binary to initial binary. From there, encoded C2 traffic over HTTP, which is a hub in the flowchart that can lead to follow-up malware, spambot activity, data exfiltration and updating the binary. " width="900" height="452" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-116680" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3. Flowchart for an Emotet infection.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Since Dec. 21, 2020, the initial binary for Emotet has been a Windows DLL file. Previously, this binary had been a Windows EXE file.</p>
<p>Emotet C2 traffic consists of encoded or otherwise encrypted data sent over HTTP. This C2 activity can use either standard or non-standard TCP ports associated with HTTP traffic. This C2 activity also consists of data exfiltration and traffic to update the initial Emotet binary.</p>
<p>Since Emotet is also a malware dropper, the victim may become infected with other malware. Analysts should search for traffic from other malware when investigating traffic from an Emotet-infected host.</p>
<p>Finally, an Emotet-infected host may also become a spambot generating large amounts of traffic over TCP ports associated with SMTP like TCP ports 25, 465 and 587.</p>
<h2>Pcaps of Emotet Infection Activity</h2>
<p>Five password-protected ZIP archives containing pcaps of recent Emotet infection traffic are available at <a href="https://github.com/pan-unit42/wireshark-tutorial-Emotet-traffic">this GitHub repository</a>. Once on the GitHub page, click on each of the ZIP archive entries and download them, as shown in Figures 4 and 5.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116682" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116682" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116682" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-33.jpeg" alt="The screenshot shows how to download ZIP archives used for this Wireshark tutorial from the GitHub repository. " width="900" height="598" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-116682" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4. GitHub repository with links to ZIP archives used for this tutorial.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_116684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116684" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116684" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-34.jpeg" alt="The screenshot shows where to click to download one of the ZIP archives used for this Wireshark Tutorial on analyzing Emotet infection traffic. " width="900" height="549" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-116684" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 5. Downloading one of the ZIP archives for this tutorial.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Use <strong><em>infected</em></strong> as the password to extract pcaps from these ZIP archives. This should give you the following five pcap files:</p>
<ul>
<li>Example-1-2021-01-06-Emotet-infection.pcap</li>
<li>Example-2-2021-01-05-Emotet-with-spambot-traffic-part-1.pcap</li>
<li>Example-3-2021-01-05-Emotet-with-spambot-traffic-part-2.pcap</li>
<li>Example-4-2021-01-05-Emotet-infection-with-Trickbot.pcap</li>
<li>Example-5-2020-08-18-Emotet-infection-with-Qakbot.pcap</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example 1: Emotet Infection Traffic</h2>
<p>Open <strong><em>Example-1-2021-01-06-Emotet-infection.pcap</em></strong> in Wireshark and use a basic web filter as described in our previous<a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/using-wireshark-display-filter-expressions/"> tutorial about Wireshark filters</a>. The basic filter for Wireshark 3.x is:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">(http.request or tls.handshake.type eq 1) and !(ssdp)</span></p>
<p>If you’ve set up Wireshark according to our initial <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-customizing-wireshark-changing-column-display/">tutorial about customizing Wireshark displays</a>, your display should look similar to Figure 6.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116686" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116686" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116686" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-35.jpeg" alt="Figure 6. Our first pcap in this tutorial filtered in Wireshark." width="900" height="582" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-116686" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 6. Our first pcap in this tutorial filtered in Wireshark.</figcaption></figure>
<p>As shown in Figure 6, the first five HTTP GET requests represent four URLs used to retrieve the initial Emotet DLL. The traffic is:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">hangarlastik[.]com GET /cgi-bin/Ui4n/</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">hangarlastik[.]com GET /cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">padreescapes[.]com GET /blog/0I/</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">sarture[.]com GET /wp-includes/JD8/</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">seo.udaipurkart[.]com GET /rx-5700-6hnr7/Sgms/</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The first two URLs indicate <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">hangarlastik[.]com</span> no longer had the Emotet DLL file it had been hosting. Follow TCP streams for each of these requests to see replies to each of the HTTP GET requests.</p>
<p>An easier way to see the HTTP responses is to update your Wireshark basic web filter to include HTTP responses:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">(http.request <strong>or http.response</strong> or tls.handshake.type eq 1) and !(ssdp)</span></p>
<p>This will show HTTP responses in the <strong><em>Info</em></strong> column, as illustrated in Figure 7.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116688" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116688" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116688" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-36.jpeg" alt="Figure 7. Adding HTTP responses to the Wireshark display filter." width="900" height="382" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-116688" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 7. Adding HTTP responses to the Wireshark display filter.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now we have a clearer picture of what happened when the Word macro tried to retrieve an Emotet DLL:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">hangarlastik[.]com GET /cgi-bin/Ui4n/</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">HTTP/1.1 302 Found</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">hangarlastik[.]com GET /cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">HTTP/1.1 200 OK</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">padreescapes[.]com GET /blog/0I/</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">sarture[.]com GET /wp-includes/JD8/</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">seo.udaipurkart[.]com GET /rx-5700-6hnr7/Sgms/</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The only <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">200 OK</span> was a reply for a suspended page notification from <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">hangarlastik[.]com</span>.</p>
<p>The HTTP GET request to <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">seo.udaipurkart[.]com</span> does not show a response, so follow the TCP stream for this request, as shown in Figure 8.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_116690" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116690" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116690" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-37.jpeg" alt="Figure 8. Following TCP stream for the HTTP request to seo.udaipurkart[.]com." width="900" height="657" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-116690" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 8. Following TCP stream for the HTTP request to seo.udaipurkart[.]com.</figcaption></figure><br />
The TCP stream shows indicators that <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">seo.udaipurkart[.]com</span> returned a Windows DLL file, as shown in Figure 9.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_116692" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116692" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116692" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-38.jpeg" alt="Figure 9.

Indicators of a DLL file returned from seo.udaipurkart[.]com.</figcaption></figure>Export this DLL from the pcap by using the menu path: <strong><em>File &#8211;&gt; Export Objects &#8211;&gt; HTTP,</em></strong> as shown in Figure 10. As always, we recommend you do not export this file in a Windows environment, since the DLL is Windows-based malware.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116694" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116694" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116694" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-39.jpeg" alt="Figure 10. Exporting the Emotet DLL from our first pcap." width="900" height="447" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-116694" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 10. Exporting the Emotet DLL from our first pcap.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The SHA256 hash for this extracted DLL is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">8e37a82ff94c03a5be3f9dd76b9dfc335a0f70efc0d8fd3dca9ca34dd287de1b</span></p>
<p>Emotet C2 traffic is encoded data sent using HTTP POST requests. You can easily find these requests in Wireshark using the following filter:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">http.request.method eq POST</span></p>
<p>The results are shown in Figure 11.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116696" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116696" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116696" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40.jpeg" alt="Figure 11. Filtering for HTTP POST requests in our first pcap." width="900" height="536" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-116696" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 11. Filtering for HTTP POST requests in our first pcap.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In our first pcap, Emotet C2 traffic consists of HTTP POST requests to:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">5.2.136[.]90</span> over TCP port <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">80</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">167.71.4[.]0</span> over TCP port <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">8080</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Emotet generates two types of HTTP POST requests for its C2 traffic. The first type of POST request ends with <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">HTTP/1.1.</span> The second type of POST request ends with <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">HTTP/1.1 (application/x-www-form-urlencoded)</span>.</p>
<p>Follow the TCP stream for the initial HTTP request to <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">5.2.136[.]90</span> at 16:42:34 UTC to see an example of the first type of C2 POST request, as shown in Figure 12.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116698" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116698" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116698" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41.jpeg" alt="Figure 12. The first type of HTTP POST request for Emotet C2 traffic." width="900" height="576" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-116698" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 12. The first type of HTTP POST request for Emotet C2 traffic.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Figure 12 shows this POST request sends approximately 6 KB of form-data that appears to be an encoded or encrypted binary. Scroll down to the HTTP response to see encoded data returned from the server. Figure 13 shows the start of this encoded data.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116700" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116700" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116700" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-42.jpeg" alt="Figure 13. Encoded data returned from the server in response to the HTTP POST request." width="900" height="576" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-116700" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 13. Encoded data returned from the server in response to the HTTP POST request.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This type of encoded or encrypted data is how Emotet botnet servers exchange data with an infected Windows host. This is also the channel Emotet uses to update the Emotet DLL and drop follow-up malware.</p>
<p>The second type of HTTP POST request for Emotet C2 traffic looks noticeably different than the first type. Use the following filter in Wireshark to easily find the second type of HTTP POST request:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">urlencoded-form</span></p>
<p>This should return two HTTP POST requests to <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">167.71.4[.]0</span> over TCP port <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">8080</span>, as shown in Figure 14.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116702" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116702" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116702" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-43.jpeg" alt="Figure 14. Filtering for the second type of HTTP POST request in Emotet C2 traffic." width="900" height="199" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-116702" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 14. Filtering for the second type of HTTP POST request in Emotet C2 traffic.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Follow the TCP stream for the first of these two HTTP POST requests at 16:58:43 UTC. Review the traffic. The results are shown in Figure 15.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116704" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116704" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116704" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-44.jpeg" alt="Figure 15. TCP stream for the second type of HTTP POST request in Emotet C2 traffic." width="900" height="496" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-116704" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 15. TCP stream for the second type of HTTP POST request in Emotet C2 traffic.</figcaption></figure>
<p>As shown in Figure 15, some of the data sent in the POST request is encoded as a base64 string with some URL encoding. For example, <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">%2B</span> is used for a + symbol, <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">%2F</span> represents / and <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">%3D</span> is used for <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">=</span>.</p>
<p>Data sent in response from the server is encoded or otherwise encrypted.</p>
<p>Our first pcap has no follow-up malware or other significant activity.</p>
<p>The only other activity is repeated connection attempts to <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">46.101.230[.]194</span> over TCP port <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">443</span>. You can easily spot this activity by filtering on TCP SYN segments that are retransmissions. Use the following Wireshark filter:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">tcp.analysis.retransmission and tcp.flags eq 0x0002</span></p>
<p>The results are shown in Figure 16.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116706" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116706" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116706" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-45.jpeg" alt="Figure 16.

Filtering on retransmissions of TCP SYN segments in Wireshark.</figcaption></figure>
<p>An Internet search on <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">46.101.230[.]194</span> should reveal this IP address has been used for Emotet C2 activity.</p>
<p>The remaining traffic in the pcap is system traffic generated by a Microsoft Windows 10 host.</p>
<p>In our next pcap, we examine an Emotet infection with spambot activity.</p>
<h2>Example 2: Emotet With Spambot Traffic, Part 1</h2>
<p>Open <strong><em>Example-2-2021-01-05-Emotet-with-spambot-traffic-part-1.pcap</em></strong> in Wireshark and use a basic web filter, as shown in Figure 17.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116708" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116708" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116708" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-46.jpeg" alt="Figure 17.

Traffic from the second pcap filtered in Wireshark using our basic web filter.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Similar to our first example, we receive some HTTP GET requests before Emotet C2 traffic. These GET requests are attempts to download the initial Emotet DLL over web traffic. The first frame in the column display shows HTTPS traffic to <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">obob[.]tv</span>, which was probably a web request for the initial Emotet DLL, because <a href="https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/url/949290/">this domain was reported as hosting an Emotet binary on Jan. 5, 2021</a>, the same date as the traffic in our pcap.</p>
<p>Follow the TCP stream for the HTTP GET request to <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">miprimercamino[.]com</span> to confirm it returned an Emotet DLL. You should see indicators similar to Figure 9 from our first pcap. We can export the Emotet DLL returned from <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">miprimercamino[.]com</span>, as shown in Figure 18.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116710" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116710" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116710" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47.jpeg" alt="Figure 18.

Exporting the Emotet DLL from the pcap.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The SHA256 hash for the extracted DLL from our second pcap is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">963b00584d8d63ea84585f7457e6ddcac9eda54428a432f388a1ffee21137316</span></p>
<p>Again, we find two types of HTTP POST requests for Emotet C2 traffic. To filter for each type of Emotet C2 HTTP POST request, use the following Wireshark filters:</p>
<ul>
<li>First type: <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">http.request method eq POST and !(urlencoded-form)</span></li>
<li>Second type: <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">urlencoded-form</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Follow TCP streams for the HTTP POST requests returned by these filters and confirm they follow the same patterns seen in our first pcap.</p>
<p>After reviewing some examples of Emotet C2 traffic from this pcap, let’s move on to the spambot activity.</p>
<p>In this example, our infected host was turned into a spambot, so we also have SMTP traffic. The spambot SMTP traffic is encrypted, but we can easily find it by using our basic web filter and scrolling down the column display.</p>
<p>At 20:06:20 UTC, the pcap starts showing SSL/TLS traffic to TCP ports associated with the SMTP email protocol, like TCP ports 25, 465 and 587, as shown in Figure 19.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116712" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116712" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116712" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48.jpeg" alt="Figure 19.

Using the basic web filter and scrolling through the column display to find spambot traffic.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We can filter on smtp to find some of the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">SMTP</span> commands before encrypted SMTP tunnels are established. Figure 20 shows the results.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116714" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116714" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116714" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49.jpeg" alt="Figure 20.

Filtering for SMTP traffic in our second pcap.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We can sometimes find unencrypted SMTP from spambot traffic generated by an Emotet-infected Windows host. Unencrypted SMTP will reveal its message content, but the volume of encrypted SMTP from a spambot host is far greater than the volume of unencrypted SMTP. Therefore, most of the spambot messages from an Emotet-infected host are hidden within the encrypted traffic.</p>
<p>In this example, you should only see encrypted SMTP traffic.</p>
<p>But our next example is later from this same infection, when we finally saw some unencrypted SMTP.</p>
<h2>Example 3: Emotet With Spambot Traffic, Part 2</h2>
<p>Open <strong><em>Example-3-2021-01-05-Emotet-with-spambot-traffic-part-2.pcap</em></strong> in Wireshark and use a basic web filter, as shown in Figure 21.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116716" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116716" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116716" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-50.jpeg" alt="Figure 21.

Traffic from the third pcap filtered in Wireshark using our basic web filter.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In this pcap, we still see HTTP POST requests for Emotet C2 traffic, at least twice each minute. We can also find encrypted spambot activity similar to our previous pcap.</p>
<p>Spambot activity frequently generates a large amount of traffic. This pcap consists of 4 minutes and 42 seconds of spambot activity from the infected Windows host, and it’s over 21 MB of traffic.</p>
<p>We can quickly identify any unencrypted SMTP traffic by using the following Wireshark filter:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">smtp.data.fragment</span></p>
<p>Figure 22 shows the results of this filter for our third pcap. The filter reveals five examples of Emotet malspam generated by the infected Windows host.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116718" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116718" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116718" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-51.jpeg" alt="Figure 22.

<p>Follow the TCP stream for the last email <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">from: &#8220;Gladisbel Miranda</span> at 20:19:54 UTC. Examine what these messages look like, as shown in Figure 23.</p>

<p>We can export these five items of Emotet malspam by using the menu path <strong><em>File &#8211;&gt; Export Objects &#8211;&gt; IMF,</em></strong> as shown in Figure 24.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116722" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116722" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116722" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-53.jpeg" alt="Figure 24.

<p>Export these emails and examine them. Ideally, we recommend doing this in a non-Windows environment. <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/">Thunderbird</a> is a free email client you can use to see how a potential victim might view these emails.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Emotet is also a malware downloader. Perhaps the most common malware distributed through Emotet is Trickbot.</p>
<h2>Example 4: Emotet Infection with Trickbot</h2>
<p>Open <strong><em>Example-4-2021-01-05-Emotet-infection-with-Trickbot.pcap</em></strong> in Wireshark and use a basic web filter, as shown in Figure 25.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116724" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116724" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116724" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-54.jpeg" alt="Figure 25.

Traffic from the fourth pcap filtered in Wireshark using our basic web filter.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This pcap does not have an HTTP GET request for an initial Emotet DLL. However, the first frame in our column display shows HTTPS traffic to <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">fathekarim[.]com</span>. This was probably a web request for the Emotet DLL, because <a href="https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/url/949449/">this domain was reported as hosting an Emotet binary on Jan. 5, 2021</a>, the same date as the traffic in our pcap.</p>
<p>You should find the same two types of HTTP POST requests associated with Emotet C2, as described in our previous two pcaps.</p>
<p>This pcap also contains indicators of a Trickbot infection. Use your basic web filter and scroll down to find Trickbot traffic, as shown in Figure 26.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116726" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116726" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116726" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-55.jpeg" alt="Figure 26.

Scrolling down the column display to find Trickbot indicators in our fourth pcap using a basic web filter.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We’ve reviewed Trickbot in <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wireshark-tutorial-examining-trickbot-infections/">our previous Wireshark tutorial on examining Trickbot infections</a>, but here is a quick refresher. The following are common indicators for Trickbot:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTPS traffic over TCP ports 447 or 449 without an associated domain or hostname.</li>
<li>HTTP POST requests over standard or non-standard TCP ports for HTTP traffic that end with <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">/81/, /83/</span> or <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">/90</span>, which are associated with data exfiltration.</li>
<li>With Trickbot from Emotet infections, the above HTTP POST requests start with <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">/mor</span> followed by a number (only one or two digits seen so far).</li>
<li>HTTP GET requests for URLs that end in <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">.png</span> that return additional Trickbot binaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can easily find these indicators using the following Wireshark filters:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">tls.handshake.type eq 1 and (tcp.port eq 447 or tcp.port eq 449)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">(http.request.uri contains /81 or http.request.uri contains /83 or http.request.uri contains /90) and http.request.uri contains mor</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">http.request.uri contains .png</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Figures 27-29 show the results from each of the above filters.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116728" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116728" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116728" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-56.jpeg" alt="Figure 27.: Filtering for Trickbot HTTPS traffic over TCP port 447 or TCP port 449." width="900" height="498" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-116728" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 27.: Filtering for Trickbot HTTPS traffic over TCP port 447 or TCP port 449.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_116730" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116730" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116730" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-57.jpeg" alt="Figure 28.

Filtering for HTTP POST requests associated with Trickbot data exfiltration.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Follow TCP streams for each of the HTTP POST requests shown in Figure 28 to see if any password data was exfiltrated. The last HTTP POST request ending with <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">/90</span> contains data about the infected Windows host and its environment.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116732" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116732" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116732" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-58.jpeg" alt="Figure 29.

Filtering for HTTP GET requests ending in .png associated with additional Trickbot binaries.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Follow TCP streams for each of the HTTP POST requests shown in Figure 29 to see if any Windows binaries were returned. Doing so should reveal two Windows executable files. You can then export these binaries from the pcap using <strong><em>File &#8211;&gt; Export Objects &#8211;&gt; HTTP,</em></strong> as discussed in our previous examples.</p>
<p>SHA256 hashes for these two Windows binaries (both EXE files) are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">59e1711d6e4323da2dc22cdee30ba8876def991f6e476f29a0d3f983368ab461 for mingup.png</span></li>

</ul>
<p>Trickbot is the most common malware distributed by Emotet, but it is not the only one. Qakbot is another type of malware frequently dropped on Emotet-infected Windows hosts.</p>
<h2>Example 5: Emotet Infection With Qakbot</h2>
<p>Open <strong><em>Example-5-2020-08-18-Emotet-infection-with-Qakbot.pcap</em></strong> in Wireshark and use a basic web filter, as shown in Figure 30.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116734" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116734" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116734" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-59.jpeg" alt="Figure 30.

<p>In our fifth pcap, an Emotet Word document was retrieved from <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">saketpranamam.mysquare[.]in</span> at 21:23:50 UTC, which matches <a href="https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/url/435882/">a URL reported as hosting an Emotet Word document on the same date</a>. Export this Word document from the pcap using <strong><em>File &#8211;&gt; Export Objects &#8211;&gt; HTTP,</em></strong> as discussed in our previous examples.</p>
<p>The SHA256 hash for this extracted Word document is:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">c7f429dde8986a1b2fc51a9b3f4a78a92311677a01790682120ab603fd3c2fcb</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We also see HTTPS traffic to <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">samaritantec[.]com</span> at 21:24:40 UTC. <a href="https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/url/436011/">This domain was reported as hosting an Emotet binary on the same date</a>.</p>
<p>As in our previous examples, you should find the same two types of HTTP POST requests associated with Emotet C2 traffic.</p>
<p>Additionally, this pcap contains indicators of a Qakbot infection. Use your basic web filter and scroll down to find Qakbot traffic, as shown in Figure 31.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116736" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116736" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116736" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-60.jpeg" alt="Figure 31.

<p>We’ve reviewed Qakbot in <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tutorial-qakbot-infection/">our previous Wireshark tutorial on examining Qakbot infections</a>, but here is a quick refresher. The following are common indicators for Qakbot:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTPS traffic over standard and non-standard TCP ports for HTTPS.</li>
<li>Certificate data for Qakbot HTTPS traffic has unusual values for the issuer fields, and the certificate is not issued by an authority based in the United States.</li>
<li>TCP traffic over TCP port 65400.</li>
<li>Prior to late November 2020, Qakbot commonly generated HTTPS traffic to <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">cdn.speedof[.]me</span>.</li>
<li>Prior to late November 2020, Qakbot commonly generated HTTP GET requests to <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">a.strandsglobal[.]com</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can easily find these indicators by using the following Wireshark filters:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">tls.handshake.type eq 11 and !(x509sat.CountryName == US)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">tcp.port eq 65400</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">tls.handshake.extensions_server_name contains speedof</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">http.host contains strandsglobal</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Figures 32-35 show the results from each of the above filters.</p>
<figure id="attachment_116738" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116738" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-116738" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-61.jpeg" alt="Figure 32.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This tutorial reviewed how to identify Emotet activity from pcaps of its infection traffic. We reviewed five recent pcaps and found similarities in HTTP POST requests caused by Emotet C2 traffic. The patterns are fairly unique and can be used to identify an Emotet infection within your network. We also reviewed other post-infection activities associated with Emotet, such as spambot traffic and different families of malware dropped on an infected host.</p>
<p>This knowledge can help security professionals better detect and catch an Emotet infection when reviewing suspicious network activity.</p>
