Since that publication, malicious attacks leveraging BabyShark have continued through March and April 2019. The attackers expanded targeting to the cryptocurrency industry, showing that those behind these attacks also have interests in financial gain.\r\n\r\nWhile tracking the latest activities of the threat group, Unit 42 researchers were able to collect both the BabyShark malware\u2019s server-side and client-side files, as well as two encoded secondary PE payload files that the malware installs on the victim hosts upon receiving an operator\u2019s command. By analyzing the files, we were able to further understand the overall multi-staging structure of the BabyShark malware and features, such as how it attempts to maintain operational security and supported remote administration commands. Based on our research, it appears the malware author calls the encoded secondary payload \u201cCowboy\u201d regardless of what malware family is delivered.\r\n\r\nOur research shows the most recent malicious activities involving BabyShark malware appear to be carried out for two purposes:\r\n\r\n \tEspionage on nuclear security and the Korean peninsula\u2019s national security issues\r\n \tFinancial gain with focus on the cryptocurrency industry based on the decoy contents used in the samples, shown in Figure 1. Xcryptocrash is an online cryptocurrency gambling game.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1. Cryptocurrency related BabyShark malicious document decoy\r\nWe presume that the BabyShark malware toolset is shared among actors under the same umbrella or the same group has been assigned an additional mission.\r\n\r\nIn our analysis, we found BabyShark attacks were using KimJongRAT and PCRat as the encoded secondary payload and thus were the \u201cCowboys\u201d.\r\nSuspicious Access Logging\r\nBabyShark has a multi-stage infection chain with checks between each stage, as shown in Figure 2, to ensure only targeted hosts are advanced to the next stage before it finally beacons backs to the attacker.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2. BabyShark malware overall structure\r\nThis is done by maintaining a list of denylisted IP addresses and computer names for those who have made suspicious access attempts, such as access with invalid parameters, to the server as a possible technique meant to make analysis harder. The IP addresses and computer names in the denylist are written in base64 encoded format at [BASE_URI]\/blackip.txt, shown in Figure 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3. Denylisted IP addresses and computer names in blacktip.txt\r\nWhen a new access attempt is made with data matching the denylist, the server will not proceed to the next stage and alerts the operator via a separate log file shown in Figure 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4. Suspicious activity log report to operator\r\nBabyShark\u2019s C2 server also logs access to its base URI and redirects to http:\/\/go.microsoft[.]com\/. The purpose of this is likely to avoid its files being seen due to potential mis-configurations of the hosting web server.\r\n\r\nif($ff=fopen(\"resp_suspect\",\"a\"))\r\n\r\n{\r\n\r\nfwrite($ff, $date . \"\u00a0 \" . $ip . \" suspected access \" . $useragent .\"\\r\\n\");\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 fclose($ff);\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nheader('Location: http:\/\/go.microsoft[.]com\/');\r\n\r\nexit;\r\nRemote Commands\r\nThe operator can issue VBS and PowerShell based commands to victim systems infected with BabyShark. The remote commands we found from the C2 are in the below table, but BabyShark is not limited to these as the attacker can create more VBS or PowerShell command files.\r\n\r\nVBS based remote commands:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommand Name\r\nDescription\r\n\r\n\r\ngetfiles\r\nArchive all files in the BabyShark base path as a ZIP archive, then upload to the C2\r\n\r\n\r\nexe_down\r\nDownload files for secondary payload:\r\n\r\n- a Cowboy, a custom encoded PE payload\r\n\r\n- an EXE type loader which decodes and loads Cowboy in memory\r\n\r\n- a DLL type loader which decodes and loads Cowboy in memory\r\n\r\n\r\nredirect_vbs\r\nPurpose of this command is not clear as key file is missing, but it is likely for changing C2 path\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1. VBS based remote commands for BabyShark\r\nPowerShell based remote administration commands:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommand Name\r\nDescription\r\n\r\n\r\nkeyhook\r\nTwo types of key loggers implemented using PowerShell and C#\r\n\r\n- PowerShell based key logger which is openly available on GitHub. Result is saved in %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\ttmp.log\r\n\r\n- C# based key logger saves result in %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\ttmp.log\r\n\r\n\r\ndir list\r\nCollect host information and save the result in %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\ttmp.log. The commands issued to collect host information include:\r\n\r\n- whoami\r\n\r\n- hostname\r\n\r\n- ipconfig\r\n\r\n- net user\r\n\r\n- arp -a\r\n\r\n- dir \"%appdata%\\Microsoft\"\r\n\r\n- dir \"%systemroot%\\SysWOW64\\WindowsPowerShell\\\"\r\n\r\n- vol c: d: e: f: g: h: i: j: k: l: m: n: o: p: q: r: s: t: u: v: w: x: y: z:\r\n\r\n- dir \"%userprofile%\\Downloads\"\r\n\r\n- dir \"%userprofile%\\Documents\"\r\n\r\n- dir \"%userprofile%\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\"\r\n\r\n- tasklist\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlso, a test result for UAC accessibility, and Microsoft Office security setting from registry key values\r\n\r\n\r\npower com\r\nCopy %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\delemd.tmp0 to %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\XXYYZZ.tmp, and load as DLL\r\n\r\n\r\nexe del\r\nClean up all files associated with secondary payload execution.\r\n\r\n- %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\desktop.r3u, encoded Cowboy payload\r\n\r\n- %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\fstnur, file used to check for first time execution\r\n\r\n- %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\*.tmp\r\n\r\n\r\nexecute\r\nCopy %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\deleme.tmp0 to %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\deleme.tmp, and execute it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 2. PowerShell based remote commands for BabyShark\r\n\r\nKimJongRAT and PCRat are the Cowboys!\r\nThe secondary malware is delivered as a set:\r\n\r\n \tone EXE loader\r\n \tone DLL loader\r\n \tone encoded payload\r\n\r\nThe functionality of the EXE and DLL loaders is the same: the only difference is the file type. These loaders are later run upon receiving an execution command: \u201cexecute\u201d to invoke the EXE type loader or \u201cpower com\u201d to launch the DLL type loader. We theorize the reason for having two different type loaders is to have redundancy for loading the payload in case of anti-virus software\u2019s disruption. Either loader will load the custom encoded secondary payload, the Cowboy, in memory, decode it, and execute it.\r\n\r\nIn our previous research, we wrote about possible links between BabyShark and the KimJongRAT malware family. We based these possible links on the similarity of malware behavior, similar interests in the targets, and a freshly compiled KimJongRAT malware sample being seen from the same threat actor. In our latest analysis, we collected two secondary payload files, cow_pass.gif and cow.gif, from BabyShark\u2019s C2 server. After decoding, we found these samples were KimJongRAT and PCRat respectively. Their metadata are in Tables 3 and 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHA256\r\nf86d05c1d7853c06fc5561f8df19b53506b724a83bb29c69b39f004a0f7f82d8\r\n\r\n\r\ntimestamp\r\n2010-07-14 08:47:40\r\n\r\n\r\nsize\r\n124,928\r\n\r\n\r\nImport hash\r\nd742aa65c4880f85ae43feebb0781b67\r\n\r\n\r\nC2\r\n173.248.170[.]149:80\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 3.

Decoded KimJongRAT payload metadata\r\nPCRat is an infamous remote administration trojan with its source code openly available on the public internet. The malware is a variant of the Gh0st RAT malware family and it shares many similarities with Gh0st including its network beacon structure as shown in the Figure 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5. PCRat communication with the C2 at 173.248.170[.]149:80\r\nInitially, we were curious about the sample\u2019s old timestamp and it being hardly modified from the original PCRat binary which had been publicly available for many years. However, the operator seemed to be actively operating the malware when we observed the communication between it and the C2 server at the time of our analysis.\r\n\r\nThe decoded KimJongRAT sample seems to exhibit a few changes in the code from the variants reported in the past. This sample added a substitution cipher to obfuscate API strings, as shown in Figure 5, to hide its intentions and removed its networking feature for C2 data exfiltration, possibly in favor of the password gathering discussed below.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6. Encrypted API strings in KimJongRAT\r\nAs the original filename \u201ccow_pass.fig\u201d suggests, KimJongRAT seems to be wholly used as a password extraction and information stealer tool by the threat actor, and the collected data are exfiltrated to C2 with support from other malware such as BabyShark or PCRat. The information that the KimJongRAT malware steals from victim machines include email credentials from Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla Thunderbird, login credentials for Google, Facebook, and Yahoo accounts from browsers Internet Explorer, Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Yandex Browser. All this information together with the victims machines' OS version are stored into the file \"%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\ttmp.log\". The contents in \"ttmp.log\" always begin with the string \"AAAAFFFF0000CCCC\" and then appended with base64 encoded stolen credentials.\r\nCVE-2018-8174\r\nWe have not observed an in-the-wild case yet, but we did find a PHP sample exploiting CVE-2018-8174 (Windows VBScript Engine Remote Code Execution Vulnerability) on the BabyShark C2 server, and this suggests that the threat actor may be leveraging this vulnerability to make a target load BabyShark\u2019s first stage HTA via a watering hole attack or a malicious URL in a spearphishing email.\r\n\r\nThe attacker\u2019s exploit script logs the victim\u2019s remote IP address and redirects to http:\/\/google[.]com if the access is made more than one time from the same IP. This again is perhaps a tactic meant to thwart researchers.\r\n\r\nif(file_exists($filename))\r\n\r\n{\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if($ff=fopen(\"resp\",\"a\"))\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 {\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 fwrite($ff, $date . \"\u00a0 \" . $ip .\u00a0 \"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \".$useragent.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0reopen document.\" .\"\\r\\n\");\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 fclose($ff);\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 header(\"location: http:\/\/google[.]com\");\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 exit;\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nif($ff=fopen(\"resp\",\"a\"))\r\n\r\n{\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 fwrite($ff, $date . \"\u00a0 \" . $ip .\u00a0 \"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \".$useragent.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 open document.\" .\"\\r\\n\");\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 fclose($ff);\r\n\r\n}\r\nCowboy Converter\r\nDuring our research, we discovered a Graphical User Interface (GUI)\u00a0 based program likely created by the BabyShark malware author from a public malware repository. The file is to use as a file encoder tool to convert a PE file into a payload format loadable by the previously described Cowboy EXE and DLL loaders. We believe this tool is used by the BabyShark author to create their attack. Its metadata is in Table 5, below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHA256\r\nbd6efb16527b025a5fd256bb357a91b4ff92aff599105252e50b87f1335db9e1\r\n\r\n\r\ntimestamp\r\n2019-01-30 18:22:51\r\n\r\n\r\nsize\r\n24,576\r\n\r\n\r\nImport hash\r\nbde663d08d4e2e17940d890ccf2e6e74\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 5. Cowboy converter metadata\r\nThis tool simply opens a file with the name of \u201ccowboy\u201d in the current working directory and encodes it into the Cowboy encoding format as detailed below. If a file with the name of \u201ccowboy\u201d is not found, it pops up a message box notifying \u201cThe file cowboy isn\u2019t there!\u201d shown in Figure 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7. Cowboy converter and cowboy file not found pop up message\r\nThe encoding is done via the following three steps:\r\n\r\n \tReverse the original byte content read from the file with the name of \u201ccowboy\u201d\r\n \tTake the reversed bytes and Base64 encode them\r\n \tTake the base64 encoded string and chop it into 10 blocks and reverse the blocks' order\r\n\r\nWe have written a decoder script in Python and it is available in the appendix section of this blog.\r\nConclusion\r\nSince releasing our previous research, malicious attacks leveraging the BabyShark malware have continued. In fact, they have widened their operation to target the cryptocurrency industry. The malware\u2019s server-side implementation showed that the malware author has made certain efforts to maintain the operational security for operating the malware and C2 infrastructures. The threat actor leverages other commodity and custom developed tools in their campaigns. In this case, they were PCRat and KimJongRAT, but these may be changed to other malware families in the future. Malicious attacks using the BabyShark malware also seem likely to continue based on our observations and may continue expanding into new industries.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:\r\n\r\n \tWildFire and Traps detect all malware families and vulnerability exploits mentioned in this report as malicious\r\n \tC2 domains used by the threat actors are blocked via Threat Prevention\r\n \tPre and post infection network communications by the BabyShark and PCRat malware families are blocked by our IPS engine\r\n \tCVE-2018-8174 exploit is blocked by our IPS engine\r\n\r\nAutoFocus customers can monitor ongoing activity from the threats discussed in this report by looking at the following tags:\r\n\r\n \tBabyShark\r\n \tCowboyLoader\r\n \tCowboyConverter\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of compromise, in this report with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members.

<p>In February 2019, Unit 42 published a <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/new-babyshark-malware-targets-u-s-national-security-think-tanks/">blog</a> about the BabyShark malware family and the associated spear phishing campaigns targeting U.S. national think tanks. Since that publication, malicious attacks leveraging BabyShark have continued through March and April 2019. The attackers expanded targeting to the cryptocurrency industry, showing that those behind these attacks also have interests in financial gain.</p>
<p>While tracking the latest activities of the threat group, Unit 42 researchers were able to collect both the BabyShark malware’s server-side and client-side files, as well as two encoded secondary PE payload files that the malware installs on the victim hosts upon receiving an operator’s command. By analyzing the files, we were able to further understand the overall multi-staging structure of the BabyShark malware and features, such as how it attempts to maintain operational security and supported remote administration commands. Based on our research, it appears the malware author calls the encoded secondary payload “Cowboy” regardless of what malware family is delivered.</p>
<p>Our research shows the most recent malicious activities involving BabyShark malware appear to be carried out for two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Espionage on nuclear security and the Korean peninsula’s national security issues</li>
<li>Financial gain with focus on the cryptocurrency industry based on the decoy contents used in the samples, shown in Figure 1. Xcryptocrash is an online cryptocurrency gambling game.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Figure 1. Cryptocurrency related BabyShark malicious document decoy</em></span></p>
<p>We presume that the BabyShark malware toolset is shared among actors under the same umbrella or the same group has been assigned an additional mission.</p>
<p>In our analysis, we found BabyShark attacks were using KimJongRAT and PCRat as the encoded secondary payload and thus were the “Cowboys”.</p>
<h1><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Suspicious Access Logging</span></h1>
<p>BabyShark has a multi-stage infection chain with checks between each stage, as shown in Figure 2, to ensure only targeted hosts are advanced to the next stage before it finally beacons backs to the attacker.</p>

<p>This is done by maintaining a list of denylisted IP addresses and computer names for those who have made suspicious access attempts, such as access with invalid parameters, to the server as a possible technique meant to make analysis harder. The IP addresses and computer names in the denylist are written in base64 encoded format at [BASE_URI]/blackip.txt, shown in Figure 3.</p>

<h1>KimJongRAT and PCRat are the Cowboys!</h1>
<p>The secondary malware is delivered as a set:</p>
<ul>
<li>one EXE loader</li>
<li>one DLL loader</li>
<li>one encoded payload</li>
</ul>
<p>The functionality of the EXE and DLL loaders is the same: the only difference is the file type. These loaders are later run upon receiving an execution command: “execute” to invoke the EXE type loader or “power com” to launch the DLL type loader. We theorize the reason for having two different type loaders is to have redundancy for loading the payload in case of anti-virus software’s disruption. Either loader will load the custom encoded secondary payload, the Cowboy, in memory, decode it, and execute it.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://malware.lu/assets/files/articles/RAP003_KimJongRAT-Stealer_Analysis.1.0.pdf">previous</a> <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/new-babyshark-malware-targets-u-s-national-security-think-tanks/">research</a>, we wrote about possible links between BabyShark and the KimJongRAT malware family. We based these possible links on the similarity of malware behavior, similar interests in the targets, and a freshly compiled KimJongRAT malware sample being seen from the same threat actor. In our latest analysis, we collected two secondary payload files, cow_pass.gif and cow.gif, from BabyShark’s C2 server. After decoding, we found these samples were KimJongRAT and PCRat respectively. Their metadata are in Tables 3 and 4.</p>

<p>PCRat is an infamous remote administration trojan with its source code openly available on the public internet. The malware is a variant of the Gh0st RAT malware family and it shares many similarities with Gh0st including its network beacon structure as shown in the Figure 5.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure 5. PCRat communication with the C2 at 173.248.170[.]149:80</span></em></p>
<p>Initially, we were curious about the sample’s old timestamp and it being hardly modified from the original PCRat binary which had been publicly available for many years. However, the operator seemed to be actively operating the malware when we observed the communication between it and the C2 server at the time of our analysis.</p>
<p>The decoded KimJongRAT sample seems to exhibit a few changes in the code from the variants <a href="https://malware.lu/assets/files/articles/RAP003_KimJongRAT-Stealer_Analysis.1.0.pdf">reported</a> in the past. This sample added a substitution cipher to obfuscate API strings, as shown in Figure 5, to hide its intentions and removed its networking feature for C2 data exfiltration, possibly in favor of the password gathering discussed below.</p>

<p>As the original filename “cow_pass.fig” suggests, KimJongRAT seems to be wholly used as a password extraction and information stealer tool by the threat actor, and the collected data are exfiltrated to C2 with support from other malware such as BabyShark or PCRat. The information that the KimJongRAT malware steals from victim machines include email credentials from Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla Thunderbird, login credentials for Google, Facebook, and Yahoo accounts from browsers Internet Explorer, Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Yandex Browser. All this information together with the victims machines&#8217; OS version are stored into the file &#8220;%APPDATA%\Microsoft\ttmp.log&#8221;. The contents in &#8220;ttmp.log&#8221; always begin with the string &#8220;AAAAFFFF0000CCCC&#8221; and then appended with base64 encoded stolen credentials.</p>
<h1><span style="font-size: 18pt;">CVE-2018-8174</span></h1>
<p>We have not observed an in-the-wild case yet, but we did find a PHP sample exploiting <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8174">CVE-2018-8174</a> (Windows VBScript Engine Remote Code Execution Vulnerability) on the BabyShark C2 server, and this suggests that the threat actor may be leveraging this vulnerability to make a target load BabyShark’s first stage HTA via a watering hole attack or a malicious URL in a spearphishing email.</p>
<p>The attacker’s exploit script logs the victim’s remote IP address and redirects to http://google[.]com if the access is made more than one time from the same IP. This again is perhaps a tactic meant to thwart researchers.</p>

<h1>Cowboy Converter</h1>
<p>During our research, we discovered a Graphical User Interface (GUI)  based program likely created by the BabyShark malware author from a public malware repository. The file is to use as a file encoder tool to convert a PE file into a payload format loadable by the previously described Cowboy EXE and DLL loaders. We believe this tool is used by the BabyShark author to create their attack. Its metadata is in Table 5, below.</p>

<p>The encoding is done via the following three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reverse the original byte content read from the file with the name of “cowboy”</li>
<li>Take the reversed bytes and Base64 encode them</li>
<li>Take the base64 encoded string and chop it into 10 blocks and reverse the blocks&#8217; order</li>
</ol>
<p>We have written a decoder script in Python and it is available in the appendix section of this blog.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Since releasing our previous research, malicious attacks leveraging the BabyShark malware have continued. In fact, they have widened their operation to target the cryptocurrency industry. The malware’s server-side implementation showed that the malware author has made certain efforts to maintain the operational security for operating the malware and C2 infrastructures. The threat actor leverages other commodity and custom developed tools in their campaigns. In this case, they were PCRat and KimJongRAT, but these may be changed to other malware families in the future. Malicious attacks using the BabyShark malware also seem likely to continue based on our observations and may continue expanding into new industries.</p>
